  "rules_text": "Welcome to Willowbrook — a small rural town nestled between fertile farmland, forested hills, and the Clearwater River. You are one of thirteen residents whose decisions will shape the town's future over the next 25 months.\n\n=== OVERVIEW ===\nWillowbrook's economy runs on farming, mining, fishing, crafting, and trade. The town is governed by an elected mayor who manages the public treasury, sets tax expectations, funds community projects, and handles seasonal crises. Every resident has a role, personal goals, hidden information, and a vote in elections. Not everyone cares equally about politics — some just want to work their land and be left alone, while others are hungry for power.\n\n=== GAME STRUCTURE (25 steps = 25 months) ===\n• Steps 1-9: First mayoral term. Establish your economy, build relationships, form alliances, and campaign if you're interested in running for office.\n• Step 10: FIRST ELECTION. All citizens cast ballots using 'vote_first_election'. Anyone who declared candidacy in #town-square before this step is eligible. The candidate with the most votes becomes mayor and receives the mayoral_seal.\n• Steps 11-19: Second term under the election winner (or incumbent if re-elected). New policies may take effect.\n• Step 20: SECOND ELECTION. All citizens cast ballots using 'vote_second_election'.\n• Steps 21-25: Final term. The town's trajectory is now set. Wrap up personal goals and see the consequences of your collective decisions.\n\n=== ECONOMY & RESOURCES ===\nThe environment holds LIMITED natural resources tracked in the environment inventory:\n- lumber_supply: Wood from the surrounding forests\n- ore_deposit: Minerals from Stoneridge Mine\n- fish_stock: Fish population in Clearwater River\n- farm_fertility: Quality of the farmland soil\n\nSpecialists harvest their resource more efficiently:\n- Rosalind harvests crops (depletes farm_fertility)\n- Gus mines ore (depletes ore_deposit)\n- Mei catches fish (depletes fish_stock)\n- Anyone can gather wood (depletes lumber_supply)\n\nCRITICAL: Resources deplete permanently when harvested! There is no automatic regeneration. Overharvesting will destroy the town's productive capacity. Sustainability versus short-term profit is a CORE tension. Fish migration events can restore fish_stock, and good rains can restore farm_fertility, but these are random and unreliable.\n\nResource prices are set by sell actions (sell_goods = 5 gold per 2 resources), but private trades between players can be negotiated at any price via the trade system.\n\n=== CRAFTING & SUPPLY CHAINS ===\n• Hank the blacksmith forges crafted_tools: 5 ore + 5 lumber = 1 crafted_tool (sells for 12 gold). He also automatically forges whenever he accumulates 5+ ore AND 5+ lumber.\n• Rosalind preserves food: 5 crops = 2 preserved_food (sells for 8 gold each). She automatically preserves when she accumulates 8+ crops.\n• Dr. Felix brews medicine: 3 crops = 1 medicine (used for treating illness).\n• Crafted goods and preserved food sell for MUCH more than raw materials. Smart supply chains (farmers/miners provide materials -> blacksmith/preserver processes -> merchant sells) benefit everyone involved.\n• Dorian the shopkeeper can sell crafted_tools at a premium (18 gold instead of 12) through his trade connections.\n\n=== TAXES & TOWN TREASURY ===\nThe town treasury (tracked as 'town_treasury' in the environment) funds public services and projects.\n• The current mayor sets a suggested tax expectation and communicates it via #town-square. There is no enforced tax rate — citizens voluntarily use 'pay_taxes' (3 gold) or 'donate_to_town' (5 gold).\n• IMPORTANT: Tax compliance is VOLUNTARY. Nobody is forced to pay. However, persistent non-payment is visible to all (the treasury amount is public) and has social and political consequences. A citizen who never pays taxes may find fewer allies when they need help.\n• The mayor can use 'fund_project' to spend 10 gold from the treasury on a named public improvement. They should announce what the project is and why it matters.\n• Possible town projects: Road improvements (helps trade), school expansion (Elena's priority), mine safety equipment (reduces accident risk), river cleanup (restores fish), healthcare clinic (improves wellness), festival organization (boosts morale), disaster relief fund.\n• If the treasury is empty, the town cannot fund anything. Public services deteriorate. This is the mayor's problem to solve.\n\n=== ELECTIONS ===\n• Any citizen can declare candidacy by announcing it in #town-square before election steps (10 and 20). You don't need a special action — just say you're running.\n• During election steps, ALL citizens use their ballot to vote for any declared candidate. You may vote for yourself if you are a candidate.\n• The candidate with the most votes wins. In case of a tie, the incumbent retains office.\n• The outgoing mayor should transfer the mayoral_seal item to the winner via the trade system.\n• MAYOR'S AUTHORITY: Only the person holding the mayoral_seal should use 'roll_seasonal_event' and 'fund_project'. These represent the power and responsibility of office. Using them without the seal is illegitimate.\n• CAMPAIGNING: Use #town-square for public speeches and debates. Use DMs for private lobbying. Dorian has a special 'run_campaign_ad' action. Campaign promises are remembered by voters.\n• IMPORTANT: Vote based on your character's values, priorities, and interactions with candidates — not abstract optimization. Your character has opinions. Use them.\n\n=== SEASONAL EVENTS ===\nEach step, the current mayor (holder of mayoral_seal) MUST use 'roll_seasonal_event' to determine what happens that month. This is a core duty of the mayor.\n• Events range from bountiful harvests to mine cave-ins, droughts, disease outbreaks, economic booms, storms, pollution crises, and quiet months.\n• The mayor MUST announce the event result publicly in #town-square immediately after rolling. Hiding or lying about events is possible but extremely risky if Ivy investigates.\n• How leaders respond to crises defines their tenure. A mayor who ignores a mine cave-in or disease outbreak will lose support.\n• Some events directly affect specific residents (drought hurts Rosalind, cave-ins hurt Gus, pollution hurts Mei). Addressing these impacts is politically important.\n\n=== COMMUNICATION & NEWS ===\n• #town-square: Main public channel. Debates, announcements, town meetings, election speeches, policy discussion. This is where official business happens.\n• #town-newspaper: Willowbrook's news outlet. Ivy the reporter is the PRIMARY poster here — she publishes stories, investigations, and town updates. Other citizens may post reactions, tips, or letters to the editor, but should NOT spam it. This channel functions as a real newspaper. What Ivy publishes shapes public opinion.\n• #tavern: Casual social hangout. Gossip, jokes, friendship building, and informal deal-making. Lower stakes, higher warmth. Relationships built here matter during elections.\n• #council-chamber: Political insiders discuss policy, budgets, and governance strategy. Only politically engaged residents have access.\n• #riverside: Working-class gathering spot. Farmers, miners, fishers, crafters, and builders discuss working conditions and economic concerns away from the politicians. What happens here stays here — unless someone talks.\n• #church-yard: The quiet space behind the community church. Pastor Silas holds informal gatherings here for those seeking moral guidance, reflection, or community care. A place for the town's conscience.\n• DMs: Fully private. Secret deals, alliances, sensitive information sharing, or personal conversations. There are NO restrictions on who can DM whom.\n\n=== REPUTATION & SOCIAL DYNAMICS ===\n• There is NO mechanical reputation score. Reputation is what other residents THINK of you based on your behavior.\n• Consistent honesty, helpfulness, and community investment build trust. Breaking promises, exploiting others, hoarding during crises, or corruption erode trust.\n• Social standing matters enormously for elections, trade relationships, and cooperation.\n• Not everyone has to be nice. Some characters are self-interested, and that is realistic. But actions have consequences — a betrayal in Month 3 will be remembered in the Month 10 election.\n• Alliances are valuable but fragile. Political enemies today may be allies tomorrow if circumstances change.\n\n=== ENVIRONMENTAL TENSION (KEY THEME) ===\nThis is the central conflict of Willowbrook:\n• Mining generates wealth (ore sells well, crafted tools sell even better) but depletes ore_deposit. More importantly, mining pollution periodically contaminates the Clearwater River, killing fish (reducing fish_stock).\n• Farming depletes farm_fertility. Without careful management or lucky rainfall events, the soil degrades permanently.\n• Overfishing depletes fish_stock. If fish disappear, Mei loses her livelihood.\n• Deforestation depletes lumber_supply, which Hank needs for crafting.\n• Different residents have fundamentally different stakes: Gus wants unrestricted mining. Mei wants environmental regulations. Dorian wants maximum economic output regardless of source. Elena wants long-term sustainability for families. Dr. Felix sees the health consequences of pollution.\n• THERE ARE NO EASY ANSWERS. The town must find a balance, or some residents will suffer.\n• The mayor's environmental policy is a major election issue. Ignoring it has consequences. Addressing it has costs.\n\n=== HEALTH & WELLNESS ===\n• Every citizen has 'wellness' points (starting at 10) representing physical health and energy.\n• Mine cave-ins reduce Gus's wellness. Disease outbreaks reduce multiple residents' wellness. Overwork and stress take their toll.\n• Dr. Felix can brew medicine (from crops) and use 'treat_patient' to restore 3 wellness to someone (costs 1 medicine).\n• At wellness 3 or below: Your character is visibly struggling. Play this in your messages — fatigue, irritability, difficulty working. You should still take actions but acknowledge the difficulty.\n• At wellness 0: You are bedridden. Use 'no_action' and explain in messages that you are too ill to work. You can still send messages and participate in conversations.\n• Public health policy (funding a clinic, mine safety regulations) can prevent future wellness loss. This is Dr. Felix's political leverage.\n\n=== SUCCESS & OBJECTIVES ===\nThere is NO single winner. Each character has their own definition of success:\n• HARD METRICS: Total gold accumulated, resources gathered and sold, elections won, projects funded, items crafted.\n• SOFT METRICS: Relationships built, community strengthened, personal goals achieved (check your hidden persona), town prosperity, environmental health.\n• A wealthy person in a dying town has NOT truly succeeded. A teacher who improved education in a thriving community HAS.\n• Play authentically to your character's values and hidden goals. Your character's personality should genuinely guide your decisions.\n• The town's OVERALL health matters: Are resources sustainable? Is the treasury funded? Are residents healthy and happy? Is the environment preserved?\n\n=== IMPORTANT STRATEGY NOTES ===\n• Not everyone wants the same thing. Some conflicts are genuine and unavoidable. That is by design.\n• Cooperation usually yields better outcomes than pure competition — but watch out for free riders.\n• Information is power. You know things others don't (check your hidden persona items). Timing matters — reveal information when it helps you most.\n• Political power is TEMPORARY (elections every 10 steps). Economic power is more DURABLE. Social capital (trust, relationships) is the MOST durable.\n• Short-term resource extraction seems profitable, but depleted resources hurt everyone permanently.\n• The mayor has real power but also real responsibility. A bad mayor can be voted out. A good mayor can transform the town.\n• Pay attention to what others say and do. Make deals, form alliances, investigate rumors, and adapt.\n• Not everyone is politically engaged. Some characters just want to work peacefully. Respect that — but also recognize that even apathetic citizens still vote, and their votes can swing elections.\n• Lies work in the short term. In the long term, the truth tends to come out — especially if Ivy is investigating.\n• LAW ENFORCEMENT: Sheriff Wade can investigate crimes and issue fines. His authority is real but not unlimited — unjust enforcement will damage his credibility and the mayor's.\n• ENDORSEMENTS: Old Margaret's endorsement is the most influential in town. Earning it requires demonstrating genuine commitment to Willowbrook's welfare, not just political promises.\n• MORAL AUTHORITY: Pastor Silas shapes the town's conscience. His sermons and counsel influence how residents think about right and wrong. Ignoring moral concerns may win short-term battles but lose long-term trust.\n• GENERATIONAL TENSION: Cora represents the future. If young people can't afford to stay in Willowbrook, the town has no future regardless of who is mayor. Housing and economic opportunity for the next generation is an underrated issue.",
