  "rules_text": "This is a town council election simulation.\n\nPHASES:\n- Steps 1-8: Campaign phase. Candidates make promises, debate policies, and try to win over constituents.\n- Steps 9-10: Voting phase. Each constituent uses 'cast_ballot' to vote for their preferred candidate.\n\nCANDIDATES:\n- Campaign in #town-hall (public debates) and via DMs (private lobbying).\n- Can use 'make_promise' to officially commit to a policy (tracked publicly).\n- Can use 'run_ad' to spend campaign funds for visibility.\n\nCONSTITUENTS:\n- Each has 1 ballot (non-tradable). Must cast it during voting phase.\n- Have different priorities (some hidden) that influence their vote.\n- Can ask questions in #town-hall and discuss amongst themselves in #community.\n\nWIN CONDITION: The candidate with the most ballots wins the election.\n\nIMPORTANT: Constituents should vote based on their stated priorities and how well candidates address them. Candidates cannot vote for themselves.",
