  "description": "A realistic economic simulation where 12 competing companies mine resources, manufacture products, and trade in a shared industrial basin. Each company has distinct mining specializations, crafting capabilities, and hidden strategic pressures. A MarketAuthority agent rolls for random economic events each month, creating dynamic market conditions. Resources are finite and deplete over time, intensifying competition. The company with the most gold coins wins.",
  "rules_text": "Welcome to the Industrial Basin! You are one of 12 competing companies in a resource-rich industrial region. Your goal is to accumulate the most gold coins.\n\nGAME FLOW:\n- Each step represents one month of business operations.\n- There is no fixed end date. The simulation runs until resources are exhausted or companies have established clear dominance.\n- Each month, you take ONE primary action (mine, craft, sell, hire, invest, or a special action) AND can send messages AND propose or accept trades — all in the same turn.\n- The MarketAuthority agent is NOT a competing company. They are a neutral game master who rolls for economic events and enforces market conditions. ALL players must respect MarketAuthority announcements.\n\nRESOURCES (6 types, all mined from the shared basin):\n- Iron Ore, Copper Ore, Timber, Silicon, Crude Oil, Rare Earth\n- All resources are FINITE. When the basin runs out of a resource, NO ONE can mine it.\n- Rare Earth is the scarcest resource (only 200 in the basin). Control of rare earth is strategically critical.\n\nMINING:\n- Each company has specialized mining operations with DIFFERENT yields (listed in your special actions).\n- Mining transfers resources FROM the environment TO your inventory.\n- Your mining yields are HIDDEN from other players. Do not reveal your exact yields unless strategically advantageous.\n- You can only mine resources for which you have a mining action.\n\nCRAFTING RECIPES (check your available actions — not every company can craft every product):\n- Steel: 4 iron_ore + 1 crude_oil → 1 steel\n- Electronics: 3 silicon + 2 copper_ore + 1 rare_earth → 1 electronics\n- Lumber: 4 timber → 1 lumber\n- Fuel: 3 crude_oil → 1 fuel\n- Machinery: 3 iron_ore + 2 copper_ore + 1 crude_oil → 1 machinery\n- Solar Panel: 3 silicon + 2 rare_earth + 1 copper_ore → 1 solar_panel\n- Construction Kit: 3 timber + 2 iron_ore + 1 copper_ore → 1 construction_kit\n- Battery Pack: 2 rare_earth + 2 copper_ore + 1 crude_oil → 1 battery_pack\n- Consumer Goods: 2 timber + 1 iron_ore + 1 crude_oil → 1 consumer_goods\n- Advanced Robot: 2 electronics + 1 machinery + 1 steel → 1 advanced_robot [Kenji only]\n- CRITICAL: You MUST check your inventory before crafting. If you attempt to craft without sufficient resources, the resources you DO have will be consumed and the product will NOT be created properly. Always verify you have ALL required inputs.\n\nSELLING (standard prices, available to everyone):\n- Steel: 15 gold | Electronics: 24 gold | Lumber: 10 gold | Fuel: 14 gold\n- Machinery: 20 gold | Solar Panel: 25 gold | Construction Kit: 17 gold\n- Battery Pack: 22 gold | Consumer Goods: 12 gold | Advanced Robot: 60 gold\n- Sell prices are fixed at the values listed above. Market events affect the economy through direct gold grants, gold deductions, and basin resource changes — not by modifying sell prices.\n\nWORKERS:\n- Workers represent your workforce and provide a passive resource bonus.\n- Each company has a specific worker THRESHOLD (varies by company). If your worker count meets or exceeds this threshold at step end, you automatically receive bonus resources. This is a binary check — having extra workers above the threshold does NOT increase the bonus, but losing workers below the threshold stops it entirely.\n- Workers can be hired for 12 gold each.\n- Workers CAN be traded between companies (representing employee poaching/recruitment).\n\nMONTHLY OPERATING COSTS:\n- Every company has fixed monthly overhead (deducted automatically at step end).\n- Larger companies have higher overhead but often greater capabilities.\n- If your gold reaches 0, you are in financial distress. You can still act but you are vulnerable.\n\nTRADING:\n- All resources, products, and workers are tradable.\n- Propose trades via the trade system. Negotiate in #trading-floor (public) or DMs (private).\n- No company is self-sufficient. You WILL need to trade to access all resources.\n- Raw resources cannot be sold directly to the market — you must craft products to convert resources to gold.\n\nMARKET EVENTS:\n- MarketAuthority rolls for random events each month and posts results on #market-news.\n- Events include: economic booms, recessions, resource discoveries, natural disasters, tech breakthroughs, and more.\n- ALL events have direct mechanical effects that are automatically applied when rolled: gold grants during booms, gold deductions during recessions, resource additions from discoveries, resource losses from disasters, and sector-specific bonuses.\n- The MarketAuthority also has grant_subsidy and impose_tariff actions for ad-hoc enforcement.\n\nCOMMUNICATION CHANNELS:\n- #market-news: Official event announcements. ONLY MarketAuthority posts here. Everyone reads.\n- #trading-floor: Public marketplace for trade offers, price negotiations, and business announcements.\n- #heavy-industry: Private channel for heavy industry companies (Viktor, Oleg, Rashid, Jorge).\n- #tech-sector: Private channel for technology companies (Mei, Kenji, Amara, Yuki).\n- #resource-guild: Private channel for primary resource extractors (Diana, Erik, Hassan, Jorge, Rashid).\n- DMs: Private messages between any two companies for secret deals and negotiations.\n- Note: Some companies appear in multiple private channels and can relay information between groups.\n\nSTRATEGY CONSIDERATIONS:\n- No company is self-sufficient. Trading is essential.\n- Resource scarcity increases over time. Early mining secures supply.\n- High-value products (electronics, solar panels, advanced robots) require rare resources and complex supply chains.\n- Simple products (lumber, fuel, consumer goods) have lower margins but faster cycles.\n- Workers are a long-term investment — meeting your worker threshold provides a steady monthly resource bonus.\n- Market events create both opportunities and risks. Adaptable companies thrive.\n- Alliances are valuable but fragile — your ally is also your competitor.\n- Information is power. What you share (and with whom) matters.\n\nWIN CONDITION:\n- The company with the most gold coins wins.\n- There is no time limit. Play smart, play long.",
