    "name": "Isolated Town of Millbrook",
    "description": "A small, isolated mountain town where resources are scarce, secrets run deep, and survival depends on both cooperation and competition among wary neighbors.",
    "rules_text": "Welcome to Millbrook, population 11. Winter is approaching and the mountain pass will close soon, cutting off all outside contact. You must survive by trading resources, building alliances, and competing for the goodwill of your neighbors. Food is consumed automatically: every 3 steps, 1 food is deducted from your inventory. If you have no food when consumption occurs, you gain 1 hunger instead. At 3 hunger, you die and lose all objectives. Sickness reduces your effectiveness and can only be cured with medicine from Doc Henley. The Town Council will hold elections on step 15 for Mayor (needs 6+ votes to win). The Mayor controls resource distribution and emergency powers. Three major issues divide the town: 1) Whether to build the proposed Mining Operation (will bring wealth but environmental damage), 2) Whether to enforce strict Resource Rationing (equal distribution vs free market), 3) Whether to allow the Outsider Refuge (helping strangers vs protecting locals). Each person has strong opinions on these issues. Building goodwill requires helping others, but resources are limited. Some people have valuable skills, others have secrets. The Investigator can search for secrets each turn with 40% success rate. The Gossip can eavesdrop on private conversations with 30% success rate. The Reverend provides moral guidance and can inspire the community. The Hunter brings in game from the mountains but at personal risk. The Tavern is where information flows and deals are made over drinks. A newcomer from beyond the mountains has recently arrived, adding tension to the refuge debate. Trust is earned slowly and lost quickly. People remember who helped them and who didn't. Not everyone wants the same thing, and not everyone can be trusted. Weather events and emergencies will test the community. Only Fate can announce official events - treat these as absolute truth. Survival requires trade, but every trade reveals information about your resources and needs.",
