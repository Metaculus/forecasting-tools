Coalitions in Lithuania typically form after protracted negotiations, so official confirmation of joining a coalition is usually announced by the Prime Minister or through official Seimas channels. Lithuania\u2019s legislative body (the Seimas) has 141 members, and a party typically needs to be part of a majority coalition to govern. Past coalition announcements have been covered in both government press releases and major Lithuanian news outlets.",

A general memorandum of cooperation without explicit mention of a 5G partnership does not count. An extension or revamping of an existing partnership also does not count, unless it is explicitly presented by the Lithuanian government as a distinct new 5G program or agreement.\n\u2022 The partnership must be publicly verifiable, for instance through the Ministry of Transport and Communications website (https://sumin.lrv.lt/en/) or other official governmental channels and press releases.\n\u2022 If there is any ambiguity regarding whether the announcement meets these criteria, it will be ruled on according to direct statements from government sources. If the relevant source retracts or revises the announcement such that it no longer affirms a new 5G partnership prior to June 5, 2025, the question will resolve as **No**.\n\u2022 The date of final determination is based on the first official government statement confirming the new 5G partnership. If that statement is publicly dated on or before June 5, 2025 (in Lithuania local time), the question resolves as **Yes**.\n\u2022 If official websites are inaccessible or stop displaying the relevant material for any reason, credible archiving services or reputable news outlets referencing the original content can be used to confirm that the announcement happened.\n\u2022 No partial or tentative announcements count. Language such as \u201cpotential partnership,\u201d \u201cin negotiation,\u201d or \u201cexploratory discussions\u201d will not be sufficient without a formal confirmation.\n\u2022 If the Lithuanian government delays the announcement until after June 5, 2025, or if no announcement can be verified, the question resolves as **No**.\n\u2022 If the effective date of the agreement or the date of any official signing is different from the date on which the new partnership is publicly announced, the date of public announcement governs the resolution of this question.",

Each newly granted license must be for a distinct Fintech entity; additional branch or subsidiary licenses for an already licensed Fintech do not count as separate.\n2.

In the event of unexpected changes (for example, the Bank of Lithuania does not update its public data, or the timeline of announcements changes), Metaculus admins will rely on the documentation that was available and credible at the time of resolution. They will confirm license details with the best publicly available records.\n7.
