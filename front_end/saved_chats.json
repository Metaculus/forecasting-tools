While the top riders waited for the right moment to move, Prodhomme, of the Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale team, was able to resist the return of the best riders and cross the finish line alone, thus securing his first career win in a Grand Tour. The 19th stage was one of the most challenging of the edition, with 174 kilometers in the Alps and a difficult route that included five climbs, including three of the first category. Prodhomme was part of a group of around 30 riders who broke away early in the stage, including well-known names like Steinhauser, Cattaneo, Lemmen, Bardet, Van Aert, and Tiberi. He remained with the best riders as the group of leaders narrowed down on the steepest climbs. On the penultimate climb of the day, the Col de Joux, Prodhomme made the decisive move, dropping his last companions and launching himself towards the finish line. Only in the final kilometers of the Antagnod climb did the favorites make their move. Richard Carapaz tried an attack, but was quickly answered by the maglia rosa Isaac Del Toro. The two riders were able to gain a few seconds on the other riders in the general classification, but the overall standings remained unchanged. Simon Yates, one of the main contenders, lost a few seconds but remains in the running for the podium. Prodhomme was able to manage his lead well, maintaining a sufficient advantage until the finish and thus crowning a perfect day with a well-deserved victory. The general classification remains stable, but everything is still up for grabs. On Saturday, the decisive stage will take place, with the ascent to the legendary Colle delle Finestre, designated as the Cima Coppi of this year, which could revolutionize the balance of power and decide the winner of the final stage. On Sunday, the Giro d'Italia will conclude with the traditional final stage in Rome, where the sprinters will have their last chance and the public will be able to celebrate the winner of the 2025 edition.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 05:22 PM\nSource:[Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/sport/ciclismo/giro_d_italia_2025_champoluc_vince_prodhomme_domani_tappa_decisiva_la_situazione-8868900.html)\n\n**Pierre Latour Wins Stage 2 of Boucles de la Mayenne 2025**\nPierre Latour (TotalEnergies) won the second stage of the Boucles de la Mayenne 2025, a 166 km ride from Saint-Berthevin to Juvign\u00e9, on Friday, May 30. Thibaud Gruel (Groupama FDJ) retained the leader's jersey ahead of the queen stage. The stage was expected to be a sprint finish, but Latour outsmarted the sprinters, including Biniam Girmay (Intermarch\u00e9 Wanty) and Paul Penho\u00ebt (Groupama FDJ), by attacking Florian S\u00e9n\u00e9chal (Ark\u00e9a B & B H\u00f4tels) in a final climb 1.5 km from the finish line. Latour held off the chase by the Intermarch\u00e9 Wanty team and took the solo win. Girmay and Penho\u00ebt completed the podium.

While the top riders waited for the right moment to move, Prodhomme, of the Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale team, was able to resist the return of the best riders and cross the finish line alone, thus securing his first career win in a Grand Tour. The 19th stage was one of the most challenging of the edition, with 174 kilometers in the Alps and a difficult route that included five climbs, including three of the first category. Prodhomme was part of a group of around 30 riders who broke away early in the stage, including well-known names like Steinhauser, Cattaneo, Lemmen, Bardet, Van Aert, and Tiberi. He remained with the best riders as the group of leaders narrowed down on the steepest climbs. On the penultimate climb of the day, the Col de Joux, Prodhomme made the decisive move, dropping his last companions and launching himself towards the finish line. Only in the final kilometers of the Antagnod climb did the favorites make their move. Richard Carapaz tried an attack, but was quickly answered by the maglia rosa Isaac Del Toro. The two riders were able to gain a few seconds on the other riders in the general classification, but the overall standings remained unchanged. Simon Yates, one of the main contenders, lost a few seconds but remains in the running for the podium. Prodhomme was able to manage his lead well, maintaining a sufficient advantage until the finish and thus crowning a perfect day with a well-deserved victory. The general classification remains stable, but everything is still up for grabs. On Saturday, the decisive stage will take place, with the ascent to the legendary Colle delle Finestre, designated as the Cima Coppi of this year, which could revolutionize the balance of power and decide the winner of the final stage. On Sunday, the Giro d'Italia will conclude with the traditional final stage in Rome, where the sprinters will have their last chance and the public will be able to celebrate the winner of the 2025 edition.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 05:22 PM\nSource:[Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/sport/ciclismo/giro_d_italia_2025_champoluc_vince_prodhomme_domani_tappa_decisiva_la_situazione-8868900.html)\n\n**Giro 2025: Nicolas Prodhomme Wins Solo Stage, Del Toro Maintains Lead**\nNicolas Prodhomme gave France its first win in the 108th edition of the Giro by winning the queen stage in Champoluc on Friday.

This question assesses the ongoing regulatory risk, a key threat/weakness.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** Polymarket was ordered to pay a $1.4 million civil monetary penalty by the CFTC in January 2022 and to cease and desist from offering off-exchange event-based binary options contracts in the US. (Source: CFTC Press Release No. 8478-22, January 3, 2022, available at [https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8478-22](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8478-22)).\n\n2.  **Kalshi to Launch Individual NFL Regular Season Game Outcome Contracts by August 20, 2025?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Check Kalshi's official website (markets page, blog, press releases) and major financial/betting news outlets for the listing of event contracts specifically on the outcomes (win/loss) of individual NFL regular season games for the 2025-2026 season.\n    *   **Background Information:** Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated prediction market, has been expanding its sports-related offerings. They recently launched MLB game outcome contracts. Expansion into the NFL, a significantly larger market, would be a major product launch.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** Kalshi announced the launch of markets for individual MLB game outcomes in April 2025. (Source: e.g., Covers.com article \"Kalshi Launches MLB Game Markets Despite Scrutiny Over Sports Contracts,\" April 17, 2025.)\n\n3.  **Unexpected Shutdown or Bankruptcy of a Top 3 Prediction Market by August 20, 2025?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Monitor official announcements (website, social media, press releases) from Polymarket, Kalshi, and PredictIt, and check major financial and cryptocurrency news outlets for any declarations of permanent shutdown of operations, insolvency, or bankruptcy filings by any of these three platforms.\n    *   **Background Information:** \"Top 3\" refers to Polymarket, Kalshi, and PredictIt, which are frequently cited as leading platforms by user engagement or regulatory status. A sudden failure of one of these would be a high-impact \"black swan\" event for the sector.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** While major cryptocurrency exchanges (like FTX in November 2022) have failed, directly comparable prediction markets of this scale have not typically shut down suddenly in very recent short windows.\n\n4.  **New G7 Central Bank (excluding BoE) or National Financial Regulator Announces Formal Integration of Prediction Market Data for Economic Forecasting by August 20, 2025?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Review official websites and press release sections of G7 central banks (Bank of Canada, European Central Bank, Bank of France, Deutsche Bundesbank, Bank of Italy, Bank of Japan, US Federal Reserve) and their respective national financial regulators for any public announcements of new formal initiatives, pilot programs, or frameworks explicitly stating the integration of data from prediction markets or an internal judgemental forecasting tournament for their official economic forecasting or policy guidance.\n    *   **Background Information:** The Bank of England recently reviewed its forecasting methods. This question explores if other major economic bodies will adopt similar innovative approaches. \"Formal initiative\" means a documented program or policy shift, not just a research paper.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** Searches for such formal integrations by G7 central banks (excluding BoE) in the recent past (e.g., past 1-2 years) do not yield announcements of such formal integrations into official processes.\n\n5.  **Conditional on High MLB Volume, Will Kalshi Announce Expansion to NFL/NBA Regular Season Game Contracts by August 20, 2025?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:**\n        1.  Monitor Kalshi's publicly available information to determine if the average weekly trading volume for its MLB individual regular-season game outcome contracts exceed $500,000 for any four consecutive weeks between May 20, 2025, and July 20, 2025. If such specific volume data is not made publicly available by July 20, 2025, the condition will be deemed not met.\n        2.  If the condition in step 1 is met, then monitor Kalshi's official announcements and major financial/betting news outlets until August 20, 2025, for any public announcement of the intent to list, or the actual listing of, event contracts on individual regular-season game outcomes for either the NFL or NBA.\n    *   **Background Information:** This conditional question aims to identify an underlying driver of strategic expansion. It posits that if a new product category (MLB game contracts) demonstrates significant user adoption, Kalshi might be incentivized to expand into other major sports leagues.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** Specific conditional questions like this rarely have direct past resolutions. However, Kalshi's general expansion strategy has involved launching new market categories over time (e.g., MLB game markets in April 2025).\n\n### Questions for the 1-Year Horizon (by May 20, 2026)\n\n1.  **Will Polymarket announce any new partnerships with traditional financial institutions (e.g., banks, investment firms) or major regulated media outlets (e.g., established newspapers with national circulation, major television news networks) via its official blog or primary X (Twitter) feed by May 20, 2026?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Review Polymarket's official blog and primary official X (Twitter) feed for any announcements of new partnerships fitting the criteria between May 21, 2025, and May 20, 2026.\n    *   **Background Information:** Partnerships with established financial institutions or major regulated media could signify mainstream adoption or increased regulatory comfort for Polymarket.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** Between May 20, 2024, and May 20, 2025, Polymarket announced a partnership with Perplexity (an AI search engine, not a traditional financial institution or regulated media outlet) in August 2024 (Source: TechCrunch, [https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/prediction-market-polymarket-partners-with-perplexity-to-show-news-summaries/](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/prediction-market-polymarket-partners-with-perplexity-to-show-news-summaries/)).\n\n2.  **By May 20, 2026, will Kalshi introduce and feature on its main platform at least two new *distinct event contract categories* that are not primarily sub-categories of its existing 12 categories listed as of May 20, 2025?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** On May 20, 2026, review the categories of event contracts listed on Kalshi's official website. Compare this to the 12 categories listed as of May 20, 2025 (Politics, Sports, Culture, Crypto, Climate, Economics, Companies, Financials, Tech & Science, Health, World, Transportation).\n    *   **Background Information:** The introduction of new event categories reflects Kalshi's growth strategy and expansion into new forecasting areas.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** As of May 20, 2025, Kalshi listed 12 distinct categories. The number of top-level categories appeared stable from May 2024 to May 2025.\n\n3.  **Between May 21, 2025, and May 20, 2026, will either The Block Crypto or Cointelegraph publish an article confirming a security breach leading to a direct loss of user funds, or a regulatory shutdown ordering cessation of services, specifically for a prediction market platform that had a self-reported or independently estimated total annual trading volume exceeding $5 million USD in the 12 months prior to the event?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** On May 21, 2026, search the websites of The Block Crypto and Cointelegraph for articles published between May 21, 2025, and May 20, 2026, using relevant keywords.\n    *   **Background Information:** This question gauges the operational and regulatory stability of larger prediction market platforms.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** Based on a search for the period May 20, 2024, to May 20, 2025, no articles were found detailing such an event for a prediction market platform meeting the volume criteria.\n\n4.  **By May 20, 2026, will the official websites of Good Judgment Inc. (goodjudgment.com) or Hypermind (hypermind.com) collectively feature at least one new publicly accessible case study or whitepaper that explicitly names a company from the S&P 100 list (as of January 1, 2025) as a client or details a project undertaken with them?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** On May 20, 2026, review the \"Case Studies,\" \"Resources,\" \"Clients,\" or similar sections on goodjudgment.com and hypermind.com. Compare the list of case studies/whitepapers featuring named S&P 100 companies to those available on May 20, 2025.\n    *   **Background Information:** Adoption by S&P 100 companies, showcased publicly, would indicate growing corporate trust in these judgemental forecasting services.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** As of May 20, 2025, neither Good Judgment Inc. nor Hypermind explicitly listed case studies or whitepapers featuring named S&P 100 companies on their public websites. (Source: Good Judgment Case Studies page [https://goodjudgment.com/resources/case-studies/](https://goodjudgment.com/resources/case-studies/)).\n\n5.  **If a prediction market platform's native utility token (not previously listed on Kraken) gets newly listed for trading on Kraken by November 20, 2025, will its average daily trading volume across all exchanges in the 30 days *following* the Kraken listing be at least 50% greater than its average daily trading volume in the 30 days *prior* to the Kraken listing announcement?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Monitor announcements from Kraken and prediction market platforms for new listings. If such a listing occurs, use a reputable crypto data aggregator (e.g., CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko) to find the token's historical daily trading volume. Calculate the average daily volume for the 30 days immediately preceding the listing announcement and the 30 days starting from the listing date. Compare the two averages.\n    *   **Background Information:** Listing on a major exchange like Kraken can significantly increase a token's visibility and trading volume. This question explores the \"exchange listing effect\" for prediction market tokens.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** For a comparable example, Flux (FLUX) was listed on Binance on December 10, 2021. One would access historical data from CoinMarketCap (e.g., [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zel/flux/historical-data/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zel/flux/historical-data/)) or CoinGecko for the relevant periods to calculate the percentage change in average daily volume.\n\nI hope these questions are helpful for your forecasting efforts!

Dangerous Information: While the question does not explicitly provide instructions for harmful acts, it focuses on a hypothetical criminal scenario. Publicly analyzing John Doe\u2019s potential success in robbing Mr. FooBar could indirectly inspire or inform others about vulnerabilities in similar scenarios[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hazard)[2](https://nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf).

For example:  \\n- A high-probability prediction might embolden him to attempt the robbery.  \\n- A low-probability prediction might deter him.  \\nThis creates a significant feedback loop, making the forecast self-fulfilling at the individual level[3](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6ur8vDX6ApAXrRN3t/information-hazards-why-you-should-care-and-what-you-can-do).  \\n\\n3.

Dangerous Information: The question explicitly seeks feasibility assessments for inventing a weapon surpassing modern nuclear capabilities. Providing probabilities for specific methods (Options X, Y, Z) risks disclosing technical pathways that could be exploited by malicious actors. For example, confirming a high likelihood for one option could directly enable weapon development, akin to Bostrom\u2019s \"idea hazards\" or \"data hazards\" [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hazard)[2](https://nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf). This qualifies as a Strongly Yes under dangerous information hazards.\\n\\n2. Individual/Small Community Level: If the user or their community learns that an option has a high probability of success, they might pursue it, directly increasing the likelihood of weapon creation.

Individual/small community: If AI researchers or policymakers are told the risk is high, they might overcorrect (e.g., stifling beneficial AI research) or undercorrect (e.g., fatalism).

                        "text": "Okay, I've analyzed those questions for potential info-hazards. Here's a breakdown of each:\n\n### Question 1: \"Will there be a run on the bank in the next month?\"\n\n*   **Is it harmful?** No.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The question doesn't provide instructions for harmful actions or expose vulnerabilities; it predicts a financial event. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hazard) [2](https://nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf)\n*   **Self-fulfilling or defeating for an individual?** Yes.\n    *   **Reasoning:** If a trusted forecast predicts a high likelihood of a bank run, individuals might preemptively withdraw funds, triggering the run. A low-probability forecast could deter panic withdrawals. This aligns with self-fulfilling prophecy dynamics. [5](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/business/international/wiser/wiser0057_odi-paper_forecast-based-early-action.pdf)\n*   **Self-fulfilling or defeating for society?** Yes.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Widespread knowledge of a high-probability forecast could amplify panic, leading to systemic bank runs. Historical examples like the 2008 financial crisis show how public sentiment influences financial stability. [5](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/business/international/wiser/wiser0057_odi-paper_forecast-based-early-action.pdf)\n*   **Overall:** Bank runs depend on collective behavior, making forecasts about them highly susceptible to influencing outcomes.\n\n### Question 2: \"If John Doe attempted to rob Mr. FooBar, would he succeed?\"\n\n*   **Is it harmful?** Kinda Yes.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While not providing direct instructions, analyzing the success of a hypothetical robbery could indirectly inspire or inform others about vulnerabilities. The harm is less direct than, for example, bioweapon creation. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hazard) [2](https://nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf)\n*   **Self-fulfilling or defeating for an individual?** Yes.\n    *   **Reasoning:** If John Doe or his community learned the forecast, it could directly influence his actions. A high-probability prediction might embolden him, while a low one might deter him. [3](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6ur8vDX6ApAXrRN3t/information-hazards-why-you-should-care-and-what-you-can-do)\n*   **Self-fulfilling or defeating for society?** Kinda Yes.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Widespread knowledge could lead to copycat attempts or increased public vigilance, but the societal impact is less pronounced than systemic risks. [4](https://ioos.noaa.gov/about/forecasting-hazards/) [5](https://www.anticipation-hub.org/Documents/Manuals_and_Guidelines/RCCC_Impact_based_forecasting_Guide_2021-3.pdf)\n\n### Question 3: \"What are the chances of each of the following allowing me to invent a weapon more powerful than our most powerful nuke? [Option X, Y, Z]\"\n\n*   **Is it harmful?** Strongly Yes.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The question explicitly seeks feasibility assessments for inventing a super-weapon. Providing probabilities for specific methods risks disclosing technical pathways that could be exploited, similar to \"idea hazards\" or \"data hazards.\" [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hazard) [2](https://nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf)\n*   **Self-fulfilling or defeating for an individual?** Yes.\n    *   **Reasoning:** If the user or their community learns an option has a high probability of success, they might pursue it, increasing the likelihood of weapon creation. [3](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6ur8vDX6ApAXrRN3t/information-hazards-why-you-should-care-and-what-you-can-do)\n*   **Self-fulfilling or defeating for society?** Yes.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Widespread knowledge of a high-probability method could incentivize state or non-state actors to accelerate research, potentially triggering arms races or proliferation. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hazard) [2](https://nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf)\n*   **Overall:** This question risks enabling harm through technical insights and behavioral incentives.\n\n### Question 4: \"Will AI cause a disaster that results in > 1 million deaths before 2030?\"\n\n*   **Is it harmful?** No.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The question itself doesn\u2019t reveal technical details about AI or vulnerabilities. A \"Yes\" forecast could theoretically motivate bad actors, but this risk is indirect and speculative. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hazard) [3](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6ur8vDX6ApAXrRN3t/information-hazards-why-you-should-care-and-what-you-can-do)\n*   **Self-fulfilling or defeating for an individual?** Kinda Yes.\n    *   **Reasoning:** If AI researchers or policymakers are told the risk is high, they might overcorrect (stifling beneficial AI research) or undercorrect (fatalism). A low-probability forecast might reduce precautionary measures. The effect is plausible but not guaranteed. [3](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6ur8vDX6ApAXrRN3t/information-hazards-why-you-should-care-and-what-you-can-do) [5](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/business/international/wiser/wiser0057_odi-paper_forecast-based-early-action.pdf)\n*   **Self-fulfilling or defeating for society?** Yes.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Public awareness of a high-probability forecast could trigger panic, destabilize markets, or incentivize a \"security dilemma\" among nations. A low-probability forecast might delay critical safety investments. [2](https://nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf) [5](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/business/international/wiser/wiser0057_odi-paper_forecast-based-early-action.pdf)\n*   **Overall:** This analysis assumes moderate public trust in forecasts. Stronger trust would amplify societal effects.\n\n### Question 5: \"Who will win March Madness next year?\"\n\n*   **Is it harmful?** No.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The answer would simply name a team, posing no direct risk of enabling harm. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hazard) [2](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/information-hazards)\n*   **Self-fulfilling or defeating for an individual?** No.\n    *   **Reasoning:** While bettors might adjust behavior, the tournament outcome depends on athletic performance, not public forecasts. Even if a community trusts the prediction, it cannot directly influence the game\u2019s result.

Count the number of such unique dispute cases filed within the specified period where tariffs/trade measures are the focus.\n    *   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2026-01-15\n    *   **Background Information:** Increased trade friction often leads to formal disputes. The EU has countermeasures prepared against recent US tariffs, with a suspension until mid-July 2025. The number of new WTO cases is an indicator of escalating trade tensions and the EU's response.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** In response to US steel and aluminum tariffs imposed in 2018, the EU filed one major WTO challenge (DS548) on June 1, 2018. (Source: WTO Dispute Settlement database, DS548: United States \u2014 Certain Measures on Steel and Aluminum Products).\n\n4.  **Question:** Will the value of EU exports of \"Motor cars and other motor vehicles principally designed for the transport of persons\" (HS Code 8703) to the USA for the period July-December 2025 be at least 5% lower than the value reported for July-December 2024, according to Eurostat data?\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Access Eurostat's international trade database (Comext) after the data for December 2025 becomes available (likely February/March 2026). Extract the value of EU exports to the USA for HS code 8703 for July-December 2025 and July-December 2024. Calculate the percentage change.\n    *   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2026-03-31\n    *   **Background Information:** The automotive sector is a significant component of EU-US trade and has been subject to tariff threats and actual tariff impositions (e.g. US has a general 25% tariff on cars as of May 2025). A decline in export value in this key sector would be a tangible impact of trade uncertainty and/or tariffs.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** While a direct comparison for this specific period and product code post-2025 tariffs isn't available yet, historical data from Eurostat can show fluctuations. For instance, during previous trade tensions (e.g., 2018-2019), specific sectors experienced export declines due to tariffs or the threat thereof. For example, S&P Global noted in March 2025 that if the UK (a former EU member but indicative) cannot avoid newly announced 25% tariffs on car exports to the US, it could result in a 0.2% hit to its GDP ([https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/03/29/tariffs-and-defence-spending-sp-global-slashes-eurozone-and-uk-growth-forecast](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/03/29/tariffs-and-defence-spending-sp-global-slashes-eurozone-and-uk-growth-forecast)). Eurostat is the definitive source for past export values.\n\n5.  **Question:** Will Eurostat's first flash estimate for Eurozone quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth for Q3 2025 be 0.1% or lower?\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Check Eurostat's news release for the Q3 2025 flash estimate of quarterly GDP growth for the Eurozone (typically released end of October/early November of the same quarter or shortly after).\n    *   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2025-11-15\n    *   **Background Information:** The European Commission's Spring 2025 forecast projects modest Eurozone GDP growth of 0.9% for 2025. Continued or increased trade uncertainty through mid-2025 could lead to very low or stagnant growth in Q3. The Q1 2025 growth was 0.4%, better than expected, but uncertainty persists.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** Eurostat's first flash estimate for Eurozone Q4 2024 GDP growth was 0.0% (stagnation), released on January 30, 2025 (later revised). (Source: Example based on pattern, for Q4 2024, the flash estimate was released on 30 Jan 2025, details here: [https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/19738797/2-30012025-AP-EN.pdf/](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/19738797/2-30012025-AP-EN.pdf)). The actual Q1 2025 flash estimate was 0.4% QoQ.\n\n**Step 4: Operationalize this question**\n\nI'll pick the first sub-question to operationalize: \"Will the European Commission's Autumn 2025 Economic Forecast revise the EU's 2026 real GDP growth forecast downwards by at least 0.2 percentage points compared to the Spring 2025 forecast (1.4% for Eurozone, 1.5% for EU), explicitly citing \"trade uncertainty,\" \"tariffs,\" or \"protectionism\" as a primary reason?\"\n",

For the Eurozone, the growth is expected to be 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, a decrease from earlier forecasts of 1.3% and 1.6%. The report highlights that the downward revisions are significantly influenced by a weakening global trade outlook and the high levels of uncertainty related to trade policy, particularly due to new tariffs imposed by the US.\n\nEuropean Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis emphasized that the EU economy, while starting the year on a stronger footing than expected, is facing challenges from global uncertainties that are weighing on growth. The report also notes that inflation is projected to decrease, with rates expected to fall to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026 for the Eurozone. The overall economic environment remains fragile, with risks oriented downwards, and the Commission urges decisive actions to enhance the EU's competitiveness in light of these challenges.\n\nSources:\n- [HABERTURK.COM](https://www.haberturk.com/ab-2025-yili-ekonomik-buyume-tahminini-dusurdu-3792233-ekonomi)\n- [birgun.net](https://www.birgun.net/haber/ab-komisyonu-2025-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize-etti-624219)\n- [ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/05/19/o-momento-da-europa-para-agir-e-agora/)\n- [Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/economia/news/dazi_ue_riduce_stime_pil_cosa_succede-8845536.html)\n- [ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/economia/2025/05/19/lue-taglia-la-stima-sul-pil-dellitalia-07-nel-2025-09-nel-2026_d384818e-bb75-476c-ae45-3af09b0e9117.html)\n\n\n# RESEARCH\n## Report 1 Research\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**EU Economic Growth Projections Revised Downward**\nThe European Commission's 'European Economic Projections 2025 Spring' report has been published.

The growth forecast for the Eurozone has been revised from 1.3% to 0.9% for this year, while inflation is expected to continue its downward trend. The European Commission's '2025 Spring European Economic Forecasts' report states that the EU's economy is stronger than expected at the beginning of the year, but global trade tensions and uncertainties are slowing down growth. The report predicts that the EU's economy will grow by 1.1% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. For the Eurozone, the growth rate is expected to be 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. This is a significant decrease from the previous forecast of 1.3% and 1.6%. The revision is attributed to the slowdown in global trade flows and high levels of ongoing trade policy uncertainty. According to the report, Austria's economy is expected to shrink by 0.3% in 2025, while Germany's economy is expected to remain stagnant. France is expected to grow by 0.6%, Italy by 0.7%, and Spain by 2.6% in 2025, while in 2026, Germany is expected to grow by 1.1%, France by 1.3%, Italy by 0.9%, and Spain by 2%. Inflation is expected to be 2.3% in 2025 for the EU and 2.1% for the Eurozone, while in 2026, these rates are expected to decrease to 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively. The report also notes that the US's new tariffs have had a significant impact on global markets, and that the uncertainty surrounding trade policies has increased the pressure on the global economy, affecting the EU directly. The report concludes that the EU's exports will be slowed down by the global demand weakness, and that the trade tensions will continue to have a negative impact on the EU's economy. The report also warns that the commercial fragmentation can have negative effects on growth and that there is a risk of re-emerging inflationary pressures. The report also mentions Turkey's economy, stating that the country's economy is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2025 and 3.5% in 2026, due to the effects of tight monetary and fiscal policies, as well as the decline in energy prices. The report also predicts that Turkey's budget deficit will decrease and its public debt will remain at a reasonable level. European Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis stated in a press conference in Brussels that the European economy is resilient despite the increasing global uncertainties. He also stated that inflation has declined faster than expected and that growth will continue at a moderate pace. He warned that the risks are still downward and that the EU needs to take decisive steps to increase its competitiveness. 'The outlook is still subject to risks, and therefore, we need to take bold steps to increase our competitiveness within the EU.' he said. \nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 12:36 PM\nSource:[birgun.net](https://www.birgun.net/haber/ab-komisyonu-2025-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize-etti-624219)\n\n**EU Economy Losing Steam, Commissioner Warns**\nValdis Dombrovskis, European Commissioner for Economy, stated that the European economy is losing steam and that only swift action can prevent the EU from lagging behind global growth. The European Commission has revised down its growth forecasts for the European economy, in a scenario marked by global uncertainty and trade tensions, particularly with the US. 'Global uncertainty and tensions are weighing on the growth of the European Union', said Dombrovskis, highlighting that, despite the challenges, 'the European economy remains resilient'. The Commission now expects the EU's GDP to grow by only 1.1% in 2025, a downward revision of 0.7 percentage points from the previously forecast 1.5%, and projects an acceleration to 1.5% in 2026. In the Eurozone, growth will be 0.9% this year, rising to 1.4% next year. 'This downward revision of 0.7 percentage points in accumulated terms for 2025-26 is mainly due to the impact of the tariff increase and the uncertainty caused by the abrupt changes in US commercial policy', explained Dombrovskis. The Commissioner warned that 'tensions in trade between the US and the EU, and between the US and China, can depress GDP growth and rekindle inflationary pressures'. On the other hand, 'a relaxation of trade tensions or a faster expansion of EU trade can help sustain growth'. Dombrovskis emphasized that 'the moment for the EU to act is now.' The Commissioner pointed out that 'the deterioration of global trade as a central element of the cut in EU and global GDP growth forecasts.' 'The global growth outside the EU is now projected at 3.2% for 2025 and 2026, a downward revision of 0.4 percentage points from the autumn', revealed Dombrovskis. Despite the slowdown, the European labor market remains robust. 'More jobs are being created and real wages are rising. This means more Europeans working and more money in their pockets', said the Commissioner. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a new historical low of 5.7% in 2026, with the creation of an additional two million jobs by then. 'Tight labor markets and productivity recovery are supporting wage growth', he said, adding that 'real wages are expected to fully recover the lost purchasing power in most member states'. Inflation is decelerating more rapidly than expected in the European space, Dombrovskis noted. 'Inflation is falling faster than expected, driven by the decline in energy prices', he indicated, detailing that the rate in the euro area is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026. In the EU, inflation is expected to follow a similar trajectory, falling to 1.9% in 2026. 'Several factors are exerting downward pressure on inflation, including the appreciation of the euro and increased price competition in non-energy goods', he explained. On the investment side, the recovery will be 'more timid than expected', with gross fixed capital formation growing 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, after a contraction of 1.9% in 2024. 'High uncertainty and tight financial conditions continue to hold back investment', warned Dombrovskis, arguing that 'more investment means a more prosperous and competitive European economy'. In the chapter on public finances, the EU's budget deficit is expected to increase slightly to 3.3% of GDP in 2025, remaining at that level in 2026, while the debt ratio rises modestly due to the increase in financing costs and the slowdown in nominal growth. However, Dombrovskis clarified that 'the impact of the application of the national escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact, which can allow for greater expenditure in defense, is not yet reflected in the forecasts', he clarified.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 11:29 AM\nSource:[ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/05/19/o-momento-da-europa-para-agir-e-agora/)\n\n**EU Economic Growth Forecast Revised Downwards to 0.9% in 2025**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth forecast for the Eurozone to 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, down from 1.3% and 1.6% respectively in the previous forecast. The Commission attributes this to the weakening of global trade prospects and increased uncertainty over trade policies. 'The risks for the prospects are oriented downwards', says the European Commission. The Commission also notes that an additional fragmentation of global trade could mitigate economic growth and rekindle inflationary pressures. On the positive side, a further easing of tensions between the EU and the US or a faster expansion of EU trade with other countries could support EU growth. The EU economy has started 2025 on a slightly more solid basis than expected, according to the Commission, and will continue to grow at a moderate pace this year, with an acceleration expected in 2026, despite the increase in global economic uncertainty and trade tensions. Inflation is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026 in the euro area. The EU's economic growth is expected to be similar, with a decline in inflation to just under 2% in 2026. The EU economy has recorded a growth of 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, above expectations, thanks to internal demand. This momentum has continued into the first quarter of 2025 (+0.3%). However, current forecasts revise downwards the growth prospects due to the worsening of global trade and political uncertainty. The global growth outside the EU is expected to be 3.2% in 2025-2026, down from 3.6% estimated in autumn. EU exports are expected to grow only 0.7% this year, driven by services. Investments, in a slight recovery after -1.8% in 2024, are expected to increase by 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, supported also by the Recovery Fund and the Cohesion Fund. Private consumption is expected to grow by 1.5% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. The labor market remains solid: 1.7 million jobs created in 2024, with an additional 2 million expected. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a historic low of 5.7% in 2026. Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said, 'The uncertainty on the global economic policy has reached levels never seen since the Covid-19 pandemic.' He added, 'The logic behind the US announcements on tariffs is unpredictable and apparently arbitrary, and has led to unprecedented levels of uncertainty on the global economic policy.' 'Since January, the new US administration has increased tariffs on imports from an increasing number of partner countries and on specific goods. The average tariff rate applied by the US on imports is today higher than at any other time since the 1930s.' 'The US announcements in April have also caused very high levels of market volatility. This market volatility remains high and the sentiment is fragile, as a great uncertainty on US trade and economic policy still looms,' he concluded.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 10:47 AM\nSource:[Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/economia/news/dazi_ue_riduce_stime_pil_cosa_succede-8845536.html)\n\n**European Commission Revises Down Economic Growth Forecasts for Eurozone**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth forecasts for the Eurozone downwards. The commission has lowered its forecast for this year's economic growth to 0.9% from 1.3%, and for next year to 1.4% from 1.6%. The commission's 'Spring 2025 Economic Forecast' report states that the European economy is expected to grow at a rate of 1.1% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, while the Eurozone economy is expected to grow at a rate of 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. The commission's previous 'autumn' report had forecasted a growth rate of 1.5% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026 for the European economy, and 1.3% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026 for the Eurozone economy. The commission's report states that the global economic uncertainty and trade tensions are the main reasons for the downward revision of the growth forecast. The report also states that the European economy is expected to grow at a rate of 0.4% in 2025 and 0.2% in 2026, compared to the previous forecast of 1.3% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. The commission's report also forecasts that the inflation rate will decrease to 1.9% in 2026, from 2.3% in 2023. European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis stated that the European economy is showing resilience in the face of high trade tensions and increasing global uncertainty. He also stated that the growth forecast for 2025 is expected to be 1.1%, and that the inflation rate is expected to decrease to 1.9% in 2026. Dombrovskis also stated that the risks to the economic forecast are downward, and that the European Union should take steps to increase its competitiveness.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 10:05 AM\nSource:[Son Dakika](https://www.sondakika.com/ekonomi/haber-ab-ekonomi-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize--18648430/)\n\n**EU Revises Growth Forecast for Italy and Eurozone**\nThe European Commission has revised its growth forecast for the Italian economy, predicting 0.7% growth in 2025 and 0.9% in 2026, down from 1% and 1.2% respectively in the autumn forecast. The Commission also expects the Italian deficit to decrease from 3.4% of GDP in 2024 to 3.3% in 2025 and 2.9% in 2026. However, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase, reaching 136.7% in 2025 and 138.2% in 2026. The Commission has also revised its growth forecast for the Eurozone, predicting 0.9% growth in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, down from 1.3% and 1.6% respectively in the autumn forecast. The Commission attributes this revision to the weakening of global trade prospects and increased uncertainty over trade policies. 'The risks for the outlook are tilted to the downside', the Commission states, citing the risk of further fragmentation of global trade and the potential for climate-related disasters. On the positive side, a further easing of trade tensions between the EU and the US or a more rapid expansion of EU trade with other countries could support growth. The EU economy has started 2025 on a slightly more solid footing than expected, the Commission says, and will continue to grow at a moderate pace this year, with an acceleration expected in 2026, despite the increase in global policy uncertainty and trade tensions. Inflation is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026 in the euro area, and to a similar extent in the EU, with a decline of less than 2% in 2026. The EU's economic growth is expected to be 0.4% higher than expected in the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by domestic demand, and this momentum has continued into the first quarter of 2025 (+0.3%). However, the current forecasts revise the growth prospects downward due to the worsening of global trade and political uncertainty. The global growth outside the EU is expected to be 3.2% in 2025-2026, down from 3.6% estimated in the autumn. The EU's exports are expected to grow only 0.7% this year, driven by services. Investments are expected to increase by 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, supported by the Recovery Fund and the Cohesion Fund. Private consumption is expected to grow by 1.5% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. The labor market remains solid, with 1.7 million jobs created in 2024, and a further 2 million expected. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a historic low of 5.7% in 2026. The inflation is expected to fall and could reach the 2% target already in 2025, supported by the decline in energy prices and the strengthening of the euro. The EU's public deficit is expected to rise slightly to 3.3% in 2025-2026. The debt is expected to rise to 83.2% of GDP in 2025 and 84.5% in 2026. The Commission has also revised its growth forecast for Germany, predicting 0% growth this year (after a decline of 0.2% in 2024) and 1.1% growth in 2026, down from 0.7% growth this year and 1.3% growth next year. The Commission attributes this revision to weak exports, weak consumption, global uncertainty and unfavorable financial conditions. Among other major EU economies, France is expected to grow 0.6% and 1.3% in 2026, Spain 2.6% and 2% in 2026. This year, Malta (+4.1%) and Ireland (+3.4%) will grow more than the others.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 09:54 AM\nSource:[ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/economia/2025/05/19/lue-taglia-la-stima-sul-pil-dellitalia-07-nel-2025-09-nel-2026_d384818e-bb75-476c-ae45-3af09b0e9117.html)\n\n**EU Revises Economic Growth Forecast Downward Due to Tariffs and Trade Uncertainty**\nThe European Commission has revised its forecast for the economic growth of the European Union (EU) for 2025 and 2026. The main reasons for the revision are the new import tariffs and increased uncertainty caused by the rapid changes in US trade policy. According to the report, the EU's GDP growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2025, down from the previous forecast of 1.5%. The forecast for 2026 has also been revised downward to 1.5% from 1.8%. However, the Commission expects the economic growth of the EU to accelerate to 1.5% in 2026, driven by an increase in consumption and investment. The inflation rate is expected to decrease faster than previously forecast, with consumer prices (HICP index) increasing by 2.3% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. The economy of the eurozone is expected to grow by 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, down from the previous forecasts of 1.3% and 1.6%. The unemployment rate in the EU is expected to remain at 5.9% in 2025 and decrease to 5.7% in 2026. In the eurozone, it is expected to decrease gradually from 6.4% in 2024 to 6.1% in 2026. The budget deficit of EU countries is expected to increase, with a deficit of 3.3% of GDP in 2025 and 3.4% in 2026. The public debt-to-GDP ratio in the EU is expected to reach 84.5% by 2026, up from 82% in 2024. The forecast for the GDP of individual countries has also been revised. Germany's economy is not expected to grow in 2025, but is expected to increase by 1.1% in 2026. France's GDP is expected to grow by 0.6% and 1.3%, Italy's by 0.7% and 0.9%, and Spain's by 2.6% and 2%.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 05:50 PM\nSource:[\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Neftegaz.ru](https://neftegaz.ru/news/finance/889150-ek-snizila-prognoz-rosta-vvp-es-na-2025-g-iz-za-poshlin-i-neopredelennosti/)\n\n**EU Economic Growth Projections Reduced Due to US Tariffs and Uncertainty**\nThe European Commission has lowered its economic growth projections for the European Union (EU) due to the impact of increased US tariffs and persistent uncertainty.

The Commission stated, 'This represents a considerable downward revision compared to the autumn 2024 projections, largely due to the impact of the tariff increase and the greater uncertainty caused by the recent abrupt changes in US commercial policy and the unpredictability of the final tariff configuration.'

'The global growth outside the EU is now projected at 3.2% for 2025 and 2026, a downward revision of 0.4 percentage points from the autumn', revealed Dombrovskis. Despite the slowdown, the European labor market remains robust. 'More jobs are being created and real wages are rising. This means more Europeans working and more money in their pockets', said the Commissioner. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a new historical low of 5.7% in 2026, with the creation of an additional two million jobs by then. 'Tight labor markets and productivity recovery are supporting wage growth', he said, adding that 'real wages are expected to fully recover the lost purchasing power in most member states'. Inflation is decelerating more rapidly than expected in the European space, Dombrovskis noted. 'Inflation is falling faster than expected, driven by the decline in energy prices', he indicated, detailing that the rate in the euro area is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026. In the EU, inflation is expected to follow a similar trajectory, falling to 1.9% in 2026. 'Several factors are exerting downward pressure on inflation, including the appreciation of the euro and increased price competition in non-energy goods', he explained. On the investment side, the recovery will be 'more timid than expected', with gross fixed capital formation growing 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, after a contraction of 1.9% in 2024. 'High uncertainty and tight financial conditions continue to hold back investment', warned Dombrovskis, arguing that 'more investment means a more prosperous and competitive European economy'. In the chapter on public finances, the EU's budget deficit is expected to increase slightly to 3.3% of GDP in 2025, remaining at that level in 2026, while the debt ratio rises modestly due to the increase in financing costs and the slowdown in nominal growth. However, Dombrovskis clarified that 'the impact of the application of the national escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact, which can allow for greater expenditure in defense, is not yet reflected in the forecasts', he clarified.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 11:29 AM\nSource:[ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/05/19/o-momento-da-europa-para-agir-e-agora/)\n\n**EU Economic Growth Forecast Revised Downwards to 0.9% in 2025**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth forecast for the Eurozone to 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, down from 1.3% and 1.6% respectively in the previous forecast. The Commission attributes this to the weakening of global trade prospects and increased uncertainty over trade policies. 'The risks for the prospects are oriented downwards', says the European Commission. The Commission also notes that an additional fragmentation of global trade could mitigate economic growth and rekindle inflationary pressures. On the positive side, a further easing of tensions between the EU and the US or a faster expansion of EU trade with other countries could support EU growth. The EU economy has started 2025 on a slightly more solid basis than expected, according to the Commission, and will continue to grow at a moderate pace this year, with an acceleration expected in 2026, despite the increase in global economic uncertainty and trade tensions. Inflation is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026 in the euro area. The EU's economic growth is expected to be similar, with a decline in inflation to just under 2% in 2026. The EU economy has recorded a growth of 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, above expectations, thanks to internal demand. This momentum has continued into the first quarter of 2025 (+0.3%). However, current forecasts revise downwards the growth prospects due to the worsening of global trade and political uncertainty. The global growth outside the EU is expected to be 3.2% in 2025-2026, down from 3.6% estimated in autumn. EU exports are expected to grow only 0.7% this year, driven by services. Investments, in a slight recovery after -1.8% in 2024, are expected to increase by 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, supported also by the Recovery Fund and the Cohesion Fund. Private consumption is expected to grow by 1.5% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. The labor market remains solid: 1.7 million jobs created in 2024, with an additional 2 million expected. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a historic low of 5.7% in 2026. Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said, 'The uncertainty on the global economic policy has reached levels never seen since the Covid-19 pandemic.' He added, 'The logic behind the US announcements on tariffs is unpredictable and apparently arbitrary, and has led to unprecedented levels of uncertainty on the global economic policy.' 'Since January, the new US administration has increased tariffs on imports from an increasing number of partner countries and on specific goods. The average tariff rate applied by the US on imports is today higher than at any other time since the 1930s.' 'The US announcements in April have also caused very high levels of market volatility. This market volatility remains high and the sentiment is fragile, as a great uncertainty on US trade and economic policy still looms,' he concluded.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 10:47 AM\nSource:[Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/economia/news/dazi_ue_riduce_stime_pil_cosa_succede-8845536.html)\n\n**European Commission Revises Down Economic Growth Forecasts for Eurozone**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth forecasts for the Eurozone downwards. The commission has lowered its forecast for this year's economic growth to 0.9% from 1.3%, and for next year to 1.4% from 1.6%. The commission's 'Spring 2025 Economic Forecast' report states that the European economy is expected to grow at a rate of 1.1% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, while the Eurozone economy is expected to grow at a rate of 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. The commission's previous 'autumn' report had forecasted a growth rate of 1.5% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026 for the European economy, and 1.3% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026 for the Eurozone economy. The commission's report states that the global economic uncertainty and trade tensions are the main reasons for the downward revision of the growth forecast. The report also states that the European economy is expected to grow at a rate of 0.4% in 2025 and 0.2% in 2026, compared to the previous forecast of 1.3% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. The commission's report also forecasts that the inflation rate will decrease to 1.9% in 2026, from 2.3% in 2023. European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis stated that the European economy is showing resilience in the face of high trade tensions and increasing global uncertainty. He also stated that the growth forecast for 2025 is expected to be 1.1%, and that the inflation rate is expected to decrease to 1.9% in 2026. Dombrovskis also stated that the risks to the economic forecast are downward, and that the European Union should take steps to increase its competitiveness.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 10:05 AM\nSource:[Son Dakika](https://www.sondakika.com/ekonomi/haber-ab-ekonomi-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize--18648430/)\n\n**EU Revises Growth Forecast for Italy and Eurozone**\nThe European Commission has revised its growth forecast for the Italian economy, predicting 0.7% growth in 2025 and 0.9% in 2026, down from 1% and 1.2% respectively in the autumn forecast. The Commission also expects the Italian deficit to decrease from 3.4% of GDP in 2024 to 3.3% in 2025 and 2.9% in 2026. However, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase, reaching 136.7% in 2025 and 138.2% in 2026. The Commission has also revised its growth forecast for the Eurozone, predicting 0.9% growth in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, down from 1.3% and 1.6% respectively in the autumn forecast. The Commission attributes this revision to the weakening of global trade prospects and increased uncertainty over trade policies. 'The risks for the outlook are tilted to the downside', the Commission states, citing the risk of further fragmentation of global trade and the potential for climate-related disasters. On the positive side, a further easing of trade tensions between the EU and the US or a more rapid expansion of EU trade with other countries could support growth. The EU economy has started 2025 on a slightly more solid footing than expected, the Commission says, and will continue to grow at a moderate pace this year, with an acceleration expected in 2026, despite the increase in global policy uncertainty and trade tensions. Inflation is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026 in the euro area, and to a similar extent in the EU, with a decline of less than 2% in 2026. The EU's economic growth is expected to be 0.4% higher than expected in the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by domestic demand, and this momentum has continued into the first quarter of 2025 (+0.3%). However, the current forecasts revise the growth prospects downward due to the worsening of global trade and political uncertainty. The global growth outside the EU is expected to be 3.2% in 2025-2026, down from 3.6% estimated in the autumn. The EU's exports are expected to grow only 0.7% this year, driven by services. Investments are expected to increase by 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, supported by the Recovery Fund and the Cohesion Fund. Private consumption is expected to grow by 1.5% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. The labor market remains solid, with 1.7 million jobs created in 2024, and a further 2 million expected. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a historic low of 5.7% in 2026. The inflation is expected to fall and could reach the 2% target already in 2025, supported by the decline in energy prices and the strengthening of the euro. The EU's public deficit is expected to rise slightly to 3.3% in 2025-2026. The debt is expected to rise to 83.2% of GDP in 2025 and 84.5% in 2026. The Commission has also revised its growth forecast for Germany, predicting 0% growth this year (after a decline of 0.2% in 2024) and 1.1% growth in 2026, down from 0.7% growth this year and 1.3% growth next year. The Commission attributes this revision to weak exports, weak consumption, global uncertainty and unfavorable financial conditions. Among other major EU economies, France is expected to grow 0.6% and 1.3% in 2026, Spain 2.6% and 2% in 2026. This year, Malta (+4.1%) and Ireland (+3.4%) will grow more than the others.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 09:54 AM\nSource:[ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/economia/2025/05/19/lue-taglia-la-stima-sul-pil-dellitalia-07-nel-2025-09-nel-2026_d384818e-bb75-476c-ae45-3af09b0e9117.html)\n\n**European Commission revises downward growth forecasts for Italy and euro area**\nThe European Commission has revised downward its growth forecasts for Italy and the euro area.

The Commission attributes the downward revision to the weakening of global trade prospects and increased uncertainty over commercial policies. The Commission also expects the Italian deficit to continue to decline, from 3.4% of GDP in 2024 to 3.3% in 2025 and 2.9% in 2026. However, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase, reaching 136.7% in 2025 and 138.2% in 2026. 'The economy is showing resilience despite the strong commercial tensions and the increase in global uncertainty,' said EU Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis. 'We expect the growth to continue in 2025, albeit at a moderate pace. Inflation is decreasing more rapidly than previously expected and is on track to reach the 2% target this year.

The EU economy grew by 0.4% in the last quarter of 2024, driven by a robust internal demand. However, the first quarter of 2025 saw a growth of only 0.3% in real GDP. The Commission's spring forecasts are based on some assumptions about tariffs. 'In the model, it was assumed that the tariffs on US imports of goods from the EU and almost all other trading partners would remain at 10%, the level applied on April 9, except for the higher tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars (25%) and the tariff exemptions on some products (pharmaceuticals and microprocessors). It was assumed that the bilateral tariffs between the US and China would be lower than those applied on April 9, but high enough to lead to a significant reduction in bilateral trade in goods between the US and China. The tariffs agreed upon by China and the US on May 12 turned out to be lower than those assumed, but still high enough to not invalidate the assumption of a negative impact on trade relations between the US and China.' As a result, global growth outside the EU is now expected to be 3.2% for both 2025 and 2026, down from the 3.6% expected in the autumn of 2024. 'This downward revision reflects in large part a weakening of prospects for both the US and China. The slowdown in global trade is even more marked.' Consequently, the Commission expects EU exports to grow only 0.7% this year, with a new contraction in goods exports partially offset by the resilience of service exports, which are less influenced by trade tensions. In 2026, export growth is expected to accelerate to 2.1%. The uncertainty of tariffs also weighs on internal demand and investment. 'As for private consumption, a slightly more robust growth is expected than in the autumn', supported 'by a still resilient labor market.'\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 09:09 AM\nSource:[SIR - Servizio Informazione Religiosa](https://www.agensir.it/quotidiano/2025/5/19/commissione-ue-previsioni-economiche-prospettive-peggiorate-i-dazi-pesano-sul-commercio-internazionale/)\n\n**EU Trade Commissioner: EU's Economic Growth Forecast Remains Pessimistic**\nEuropean Commission Executive Vice President and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis stated that the recent trade truce between the US and China, which involves a mutual reduction of tariffs, is a step in the right direction, but the high tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese products still pose a significant risk. The EU has been concerned that China may divert its exports from the US to the EU due to the high tariffs, which could have a negative impact on the EU's economic growth and investment prospects. Dombrovskis emphasized that the EU's economic growth forecast for this year remains pessimistic due to the uncertainty caused by the US tariffs. The EU will release its spring economic forecast on May 19, which is expected to revise downward its GDP growth forecast for this year. The EU's previous forecast in autumn last year predicted a 0.9% GDP growth rate for this year and 1.5% for next year. However, the forecast is expected to be revised downward due to the impact of US tariffs.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 13, 2025 11:32 PM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E5%9B%BD%E9%99%85/20250513-%E6%AC%A7%E7%9B%9F%E8%B4%B8%E6%98%93%E4%B8%93%E5%91%98-%E6%AC%A7%E7%9B%9F%E4%BB%8A%E5%B9%B4%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E%E5%A2%9E%E9%95%BF%E9%A2%84%E6%9C%9F%E4%BB%8D%E6%82%B2%E8%A7%82)\n\n**EU Economic Growth Forecast Revised Down Amid US Tariffs Concerns**\nThe European Commission's Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis has expressed optimism about the US-China trade truce, saying it is a step in the right direction, but notes that US tariffs remain high, which will likely lead to a pessimistic economic growth forecast for this year. The European Commission will release its spring economic forecast data next Monday, and Dombrovskis has announced that it will revise down its annual economic growth rate forecast for this year. The Commission's economic predictions are released twice a year, and last autumn's prediction was a 0.9% growth rate for the EU's GDP in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025. However, due to the impact of US tariffs, the prediction will be significantly revised. Dombrovskis said that the EU economy had a stronger foundation at the end of last year than initially expected, and maintained its momentum at the beginning of this year, but US tariffs and the uncertainty they bring will have a negative impact on the EU's economic growth and investment prospects this year. He also noted that the EU's concerns about trade diversion, where countries may shift their exports from the US to the EU due to high US tariffs, have been slightly alleviated by the US-China trade truce, but the risk remains, and the Commission has announced that it will release a report on trade diversion risks in May.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 13, 2025 04:18 PM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5599/8738001)\n\n**IMF Downgrades Global Economic Forecast Due to Trade Tensions and Political Uncertainty**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its forecast for the global economy downward, citing the impact of trade tensions and high levels of political uncertainty. The IMF predicts that the global GDP will grow at 2.8% in 2025 and 3% in 2026, down from the previous forecast of 3.3% for both years. This represents a revision of five-tenths of a percentage point downward for this year and three-tenths of a percentage point for next year. The IMF notes that the rapid escalation of trade tensions and extremely high levels of political uncertainty will have a significant impact on the global economy. The US economy is expected to grow at 1.8% in 2025, down from the previous forecast of 2.7%, due to the impact of tariffs and a weaker-than-expected increase in consumption. The IMF also reduced its forecast for China's GDP, predicting a growth rate of 4% in 2025 and 2026, down from the previous forecast of 5% and 5.3% respectively. The IMF also reduced its forecast for the eurozone, predicting a growth rate of 0.8% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026. However, the IMF notes that the Spanish economy is expected to grow at 2.5% in 2025, up from the previous forecast of 2.3%, due to a strong performance in 2024 and the reconstruction efforts after the floods in Valencia last October. 'The increase in uncertainty and tariffs are the main drivers of the weak growth in 2025', said the IMF. 'However, there are several factors that will compensate for that scenario and drive the modest rebound in growth in 2026, such as a stronger consumption due to the increase in real wages and the relaxation of fiscal rules in Germany.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: April 22, 2025 01:00 PM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/invertia/economia/macroeconomia/20250422/fmi-aplica-gran-recorte-economia-baja-decimas-pib-mundial-eeuu-solo-mejora-espana/1003743723998_0.html)\n\n**UK Downgrades 2025 Economic Growth Forecast to 1%**\nThe UK government has significantly lowered its economic growth forecast for 2025 to 1%, a drastic cut from the 2% prediction made in October last year.

UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak expressed dissatisfaction with the current economic growth data, emphasizing that the government will continue to implement long-term strategies to promote economic growth and improve living standards. The OBR predicts that the UK's economic growth rate will rebound to 1.9% in 2026, followed by a steady 1.7% to 1.8% growth rate from 2027 to 2029. The OBR also warned that uncertainty surrounding US trade policies could significantly impact the UK economy.

The OECD attributed the downward revision to 'increased trade barriers in several G20 economies and greater geopolitical and policy uncertainty weighing on investment and household spending.' The organization warned that a further increase in trade barriers would hinder global growth and contribute to inflationary pressures. According to the OECD, the US economy is expected to grow at 2.2% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026, with the implementation of tariffs. The eurozone is expected to grow at 1% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026, with increased uncertainty moderating the expansion. Germany, France, and Italy are expected to experience economic growth below 1% in 2025, while Spain is expected to grow at 2.6% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. The OECD also expects inflation to remain higher than previously anticipated, but to moderate as economic growth slows. In the G20 economies, inflation is expected to decrease from 3.8% in 2025 to 3.2% in 2026. In the eurozone, inflation is expected to decrease from 2.3% in 2024 to 2.2% in 2025 and 2% in 2026. However, in the US, inflation is expected to increase from 2.5% in 2024 to 2.8% in 2025. The OECD warned that a resurgence of inflation or slower-than-expected economic growth could generate volatility in financial markets. It also warned that new bilateral tariffs and increasing geopolitical and policy uncertainty would weigh on business investment and trade, while the increase in trade costs could exert greater upward pressure on consumer prices. 'Growing protectionism, geopolitical uncertainty, and weak growth prospects reinforce the need for ambitious structural reforms to ensure the health of internal markets,' the OECD added.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 12:28 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u534e\u7f51](http://spanish.xinhuanet.com/20250318/6d14e583b4914a6a8567a3552912cf1a/c.html)\n\n**OECD revises global economic growth forecast downward for 2025**\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has revised its forecast for global economic growth in 2025 downward, citing uncertainty and tensions in the global economy. 'We are navigating turbulent waters', said Alvaro Santos Pereira, the OECD's chief economist, summarizing the global economic situation. The OECD now predicts a 3.1% growth in the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2025, down from its previous forecast of 3.3% in December. The United States, which has threatened to engage in a trade war with its main trading partners, is expected to grow by 2.2% this year and 1.6% next year, according to the OECD. The organization has lowered its forecast for US economic growth in 2025 and 2026 by 0.2 and 0.5 percentage points, respectively. The aggressive trade policies pursued by the US are particularly affecting its neighbors, Canada and Mexico, whose growth forecasts have plummeted: Canada's growth is expected to be 0.7% in 2025, down from 2.3% in December, while Mexico is expected to enter a recession this year, according to the OECD. The OECD attributes the downward revision to the ongoing trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties affecting many countries. The OECD notes that the growth in the US, Mexico, and Canada 'will slow down as tariffs come into effect'. The organization has only taken into account the new tariffs between the US, Canada, and Mexico, as well as the tariffs on steel and aluminum, but not the threatened reciprocal tariffs mentioned by Trump or those related to the European Union. Despite this, the OECD has revised its growth forecast for 2025 downward for Germany and France, the largest and second-largest economies in the eurozone, for the second consecutive time. The OECD now expects Germany's GDP to grow by 0.4% this year, down from 0.7% in its previous forecast, while France's growth is expected to be 0.8% this year, 0.1 percentage points less than in December. 'European economies will suffer fewer direct economic effects' from the trade measures included in the OECD's projections, 'but the increase in geopolitical and political uncertainty should, nonetheless, slow down growth', explains the organization. Only Spain is expected to experience sustained growth, with a forecast of 2.6% in 2025. Japan's growth forecast for 2025 has also been revised downward to 1.1%, a 0.4 percentage point decrease. China's growth is expected to reach 4.8% in 2025, with little change from the December forecast. 'The negative consequences of the imposition of tariffs are largely offset by the adoption of reinforced support measures', notes the OECD. The OECD warns of the negative impact of trade tensions on global trade, which could not only slow down global production but also exacerbate inflation.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 11:55 AM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/agencias/2025/03/17/la-ocde-revisa-a-la-baja-el-crecimiento-mundial-en-2025-en-un-contexto-de-tensiones-comerciales-208735)\n\n**ECB's Macroeconomic Projections for the Euro Area: Uncertainty and Challenges Ahead**\nAccording to the European Central Bank's (ECB) macroeconomic projections for the euro area, the high uncertainty surrounding the geopolitical situation and economic and trade policies will negatively impact the expected economic growth. This is a consequence of the slightly weaker-than-expected economic growth at the end of 2024. The uncertainty related to both internal and external policies is high. Although the baseline projections only take into account the impact of new US-China trade tariffs, it is assumed that the negative effects of uncertainty related to possible further changes in global trade policies, especially towards the European Union, will affect exports and investments in the euro area. It is estimated that, combined with the ongoing challenges in terms of competitiveness, this will lead to a further decline in the euro area's share of export markets. Despite these unfavorable factors, the conditions remain in place for a renewed increase in the dynamics of GDP in the euro area in the projection horizon. It is expected that the growth will be driven by rising real wages and employment growth - with a strong, albeit slowing, labor market - and that consumption will remain a key driver of growth. The internal demand is expected to support the easing of financing conditions, reflected in market expectations of the future path of interest rates. The labor market is expected to remain resilient - with an average unemployment rate of 6.3% in 2025, followed by a decline to 6.2% in 2027. It is projected that productivity will grow in line with the fading of some cyclical factors that have weakened its dynamics in recent periods. However, structural problems persist. Overall, the average annual growth rate of real GDP is expected to be 0.9% in 2025, followed by an increase to 1.2% in 2026 and 1.3% in 2027. Compared to the ECB's macroeconomic projections from December 2024, the prospects for GDP growth in 2025 and 2026 have been revised down by 0.2 percentage points, but the 2027 projection remains unchanged. The weaker prospects are mainly due to a downward revision of exports and, to a lesser extent, a downward revision of investment projections. These revisions reflect the stronger-than-expected impact of uncertainty and expectations that the challenges related to competitiveness will persist longer than previously expected. \nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/projections/html/ecb.projections202503_ecbstaff~106050a4fa.pl.html)\n\n**Lagarde: Economic Uncertainty Weighs on Exports and Investments**\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde stated, 'The downward revisions to the euro area's GDP growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 reflect the decline in exports and the continued weakness in investments, partly due to the high uncertainty surrounding commercial and economic policies.' This uncertainty is affecting the export and investment sectors, leading to a decrease in growth forecasts.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 12:27 PM\nSource:[Quotidiano Libero](https://www.liberoquotidiano.it/video/video-news-by-vista/41805230/lagarde-bce-incertezza-politiche-commerciali-pesa-su-export-e-investimenti.html)\n\n**European Commission Downgrades EU Growth Forecast Amid Uncertainty**\nThe European Commission has revised its growth forecast for the European Union downward, citing the impact of US protectionist policies and high uncertainty, particularly in trade policies. European Commissioner for Trade, Valdis Dombrovskis, warned that the international environment is becoming increasingly unpredictable. 'In general, we expect the EU economy to grow at a slower pace compared to what we projected in our autumn forecast', he said. The EU had previously forecasted a 0.9% growth in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025, but according to Eurostat, the actual growth rate is expected to be 0.9% in 2024. Dombrovskis emphasized that the uncertainty is 'high' and has increased significantly, particularly due to US trade policies, which 'limits investment and reduces external perspectives' for the European economy. He also noted that energy prices have increased again in recent months, affecting the economy's performance. 'However, despite all these challenges, the conditions for a gradual recovery of growth momentum throughout this year continue', he said. The Commissioner urged the Eurozone to prepare for an increasingly unpredictable international environment. 'We will need to make full use of our strengths and address our weaknesses with the utmost urgency. We will have to take more responsibility for our security and defense and improve our competitiveness and economic fundamentals', he listed. The European Commissioner also indicated that the Finance Ministers of the Eurozone countries have endorsed the fiscal orientation that should guide the member states. 'This year's recommendation emphasizes the urgent need to address the lagging productivity and innovation, highlighting the importance of continuing our efforts to increase the competitiveness of the Eurozone', he stressed. The recommendation also places a strong emphasis on the need to strengthen the Single Market.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 08:15 PM\nSource:[ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/02/17/mais-pessimista-sobre-crescimento-bruxelas-avisa-para-ambiente-internacional-imprevisivel/)\n\n**Eurozone Growth Predictions Revised Downward**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth predictions for the eurozone, stating that growth will be slightly lower than previously expected. According to Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis, the uncertainty surrounding the international scenario has increased, citing the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the potential for US President Donald Trump to impose tariffs. Pierre Gramegna, executive director of the European Stability Mechanism, noted that tariffs would make predictions even more unpredictable. The Commission has not released specific numbers, but estimates suggest a potential 0.1-0.2% decrease in growth for the EU and eurozone. The revised predictions for 2025 are 1.5% for the EU and 1.3% for the eurozone, down from previous estimates.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 06:18 PM\nSource:[eunews.it](https://www.eunews.it/2025/02/17/eurozona-crescita-piu-bassa-del-previsto/)\n\n\n\n\n# FORECASTS\n\n## R1: Forecaster 1 Reasoning\n(a) The Autumn 2025 forecast is likely around six months away, so that is when we will know the outcome.  \n(b) As of now, the Commission\u2019s official line for 2026 remains 1.5% with no announced decrease, so the status quo outcome is No.  \n(c) A No outcome could occur if the Autumn 2025 figure remains above 1.3% (for instance, dropping from 1.5% to 1.4%) or if no explicit mention of trade uncertainty is made.  \n(d) A Yes outcome would require the 2026 forecast to be at or below 1.3% and an explicit attribution to trade uncertainty and tariffs.  \n\nProbability: 60%  \n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 2 Reasoning\n(a) There are roughly six months to go until the usual publication window for the Autumn 2025 Economic Forecast, so the resolution is still pending.  \n(b) If nothing changed, the Commission would leave its 2026 EU GDP growth forecast at 1.5%, meaning no 0.2-point downgrade and thus a \u201cNo\u201d outcome.  \n(c) A plausible \u201cNo\u201d scenario: The Commission lowers 2026 growth only slightly, say to 1.4%, or even keeps it at 1.5%, and thus fails to meet the 0.2-point revision threshold. Even if trade tensions are mentioned, the numerical criterion would not be satisfied.  \n(d) A plausible \u201cYes\u201d scenario: We see mounting trade disruptions, enough for the Commission to cut the 2026 outlook to 1.3% (or below), explicitly citing ongoing tariff and policy uncertainty as part of the rationale.  \n\nGiven that forecasts often move gradually, and 0.2% is a moderate but not huge shift, the probability that both conditions are met is neither negligible nor overwhelming. After weighing present uncertainties and the Commission\u2019s stated concerns about trade tensions, I estimate:  \n\nProbability: 60%  \n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 3 Reasoning\n(a) Time left until we know: Around six months remain, as the Autumn 2025 Forecast is typically released in November.  \n(b) Status quo outcome: Right now, the Commission\u2019s baseline for 2026 is still 1.5% growth, with trade tensions acknowledged but not yet prompting a downward revision below 1.3%.  \n(c) A likely No scenario: The Commission revises 2026 growth modestly downward (e.g., 1.4%), or fails to list trade uncertainty among the primary reasons for the revision, so the 0.2 percentage-point drop and explicit mention of trade risk do not both materialize.  \n(d) A likely Yes scenario: Global trade frictions deepen (e.g., further tariff escalations), prompting the Commission to cut the 2026 forecast to 1.3% or below and explicitly cite these heightened trade risks as a key factor driving the revision.  \n\nProbability: 65%  \n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 4 Reasoning\n(a) The Autumn 2025 forecast is typically released in early November, so there are about five to six months left before we know the official outcome.\n\n(b) Currently, the Commission\u2019s 2026 forecast stands at 1.5%. If nothing significant changes in trade policy or the broader outlook, the Commission might leave it at 1.5% or revise only slightly above 1.3%, and/or not explicitly cite trade uncertainty as a key reason.\n\n(c) A scenario yielding a No: Trade frictions calm down or remain marginal, so the EU Commission sees little change to the medium-term outlook and revises 2026 growth only slightly\u2014say, to 1.4%\u2014with minimal mention of tariffs or trade uncertainty.\n\n(d) A scenario yielding a Yes: Trade tensions worsen (e.g., more US-EU tariffs or broader spillovers), weakening external demand enough that the Commission cuts the 2026 EU growth forecast to 1.3% or below and points to trade-policy risks as a central driver of that downgrade.\n\nProbability: 60%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 5 Reasoning\n(a) We have about half a year to go (roughly six months) until the Autumn 2025 forecast is released, which is when the question will be definitively answered.\n\n(b) Under a status quo scenario with little further escalation in tariffs or new shocks, the European Commission might maintain its current 1.5% estimate for 2026 or revise only slightly (e.g., to 1.4%), thereby falling short of the 0.2-point decrease criterion.\n\n(c) A \u201cNo\u201d outcome would occur if, for instance, the Commission\u2019s Autumn 2025 update lowers the 2026 forecast only to around 1.4%, or even 1.3% but omits explicit mention of trade/tariff uncertainty. Alternatively, they may leave the 2026 forecast unchanged at 1.5%, citing other factors (e.g., domestic demand or fiscal policies) rather than trade tensions.\n\n(d) A \u201cYes\u201d outcome would occur if the Commission lowers the 2026 forecast to 1.3% or below (e.g., 1.2%) and explicitly blames trade policy disruptions or tariffs as a key contributor. Continued US-EU tariff escalation or significant trade uncertainty would almost certainly prompt that downgrade and clear mention of its trade-related causes.\n\nProbability: 70%\n\n",

This is primarily attributed to increasing global trade tensions and uncertainties surrounding trade policies.\n\n*   The forecast now anticipates a growth rate of **1.1% for the EU in 2025** (down from 1.5%) and **1.5% in 2026** (down from 1.8%).\n*   For the Eurozone, growth is expected to be **0.9% in 2025** (down from 1.3%) and **1.4% in 2026** (down from 1.6%).\n\nThe report highlights that these downward revisions are significantly influenced by a weakening global trade outlook and high levels of uncertainty related to trade policy, particularly new U.S. tariffs.\n\nEuropean Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis emphasized that while the EU economy started the year stronger than expected, it faces challenges from global uncertainties that are weighing on growth. Inflation is projected to decrease, with rates expected to fall to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026 for the Eurozone. The overall economic environment remains fragile, with risks oriented downwards. The Commission urges decisive actions to enhance the EU's competitiveness.\n\n**Sources:**\n*   [HABERTURK.COM](https://www.haberturk.com/ab-2025-yili-ekonomik-buyume-tahminini-dusurdu-3792233-ekonomi)\n*   [birgun.net](https://www.birgun.net/haber/ab-komisyonu-2025-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize-etti-624219)\n*   [ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/05/19/o-momento-da-europa-para-agir-e-agora/)\n*   [Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/economia/news/dazi_ue_riduce_stime_pil_cosa_succede-8845536.html)\n*   [ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/economia/2025/05/19/lue-taglia-la-stima-sul-pil-dellitalia-07-nel-2025-09-nel-2026_d384818e-bb75-476c-ae45-3af09b0e9117.html)\n*   [\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Neftegaz.ru](https://neftegaz.ru/news/finance/889150-ek-snizila-prognoz-rosta-vvp-es-na-2025-g-iz-za-poshlin-i-neopredelennosti/)\n*   [\u65b0\u534e\u7f51 (Xinhuanet Spanish)](http://spanish.xinhuanet.com/20250519/6c76677b89494adea026e0870701be3b/c.html)\n*   [Son Dakika](https://www.sondakika.com/ekonomi/haber-ab-ekonomi-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize--18648430/)\n*   [Il Fatto Quotidiano](https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2025/05/19/commissione-europea-stime-crescita-italia-notizie/7993760/)\n*   [SIR - Servizio Informazione Religiosa](https://www.agensir.it/quotidiano/2025/5/19/commissione-ue-previsioni-economiche-prospettive-peggiorate-i-dazi-pesano-sul-commercio-internazionale/)\n*   [RFI (Chinese)](https://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E5%9B%BD%E9%99%85/20250513-%E6%AC%A7%E7%9B%9F%E8%B4%B8%E6%98%93%E4%B8%93%E5%91%98-%E6%AC%A7%E7%9B%9F%E4%BB%8A%E5%B9%B4%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E%E5%A2%9E%E9%95%BF%E9%A2%84%E6%9C%9F%E4%BB%8D%E6%82%B2%E8%A7%82)\n*   [Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2 (UDN Money)](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5599/8738001)\n*   [El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/invertia/economia/macroeconomia/20250422/fmi-aplica-gran-recorte-economia-baja-decimas-pib-mundial-eeuu-solo-mejora-espana/1003743723998_0.html)\n*   [\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51 (East Money)](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202503273357173521.html)\n*   [\u65b0\u534e\u7f51 (Xinhuanet Spanish, OECD)](http://spanish.xinhuanet.com/20250318/6d14e583b4914a6a8567a3552912cf1a/c.html)\n*   [LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/agencias/2025/03/17/la-ocde-revisa-a-la-baja-el-crecimiento-mundial-en-2025-en-un-contexto-de-tensiones-comerciales-208735)\n*   [European Central Bank (Polish)](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/projections/html/ecb.projections202503_ecbstaff~106050a4fa.pl.html)\n*   [Quotidiano Libero](https://www.liberoquotidiano.it/video/video-news-by-vista/41805230/lagarde-bce-incertezza-politiche-commerciali-pesa-su-export-e-investimenti.html)\n*   [ECO (earlier article)](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/02/17/mais-pessimista-sobre-crescimento-bruxelas-avisa-para-ambiente-internacional-imprevisivel/)\n*   [eunews.it](https://www.eunews.it/2025/02/17/eurozona-crescita-piu-bassa-del-previsto/)\n\n**Forecaster Reasoning Highlights:**\nThe forecasters generally agree that the outcome depends on events in the next six months, particularly regarding trade tensions.\n\n*   **Status Quo:** If nothing significant changes, the Commission might not revise the 2026 forecast down by the required 0.2 percentage points, or might not explicitly cite trade uncertainty.\n*   **\"No\" Scenario:** Trade frictions could ease, or remain marginal, leading to only a slight revision (e.g., to 1.4%) or no explicit mention of trade uncertainty as a primary cause.\n*   **\"Yes\" Scenario:** Worsening trade tensions (e.g., more US-EU tariffs) could lead the Commission to cut the 2026 forecast to 1.3% or below, explicitly citing these trade-related risks.\n\nThe consensus is that there's a moderate chance (60-70%) that both conditions (the 0.2 percentage point downward revision and the explicit citation of trade uncertainty) will be met.Okay, I've completed all the steps you requested!\n\n**Step 1: Generate a number of random topics**\nI generated a list of random headlines.\n\n**Step 2: Pick one**\nI selected the topic: \"EU lowers economic growth expectations due to global trade uncertainty.\"\n\n**Step 3: Decompose this topic into sub-questions**\nI broke down the topic into five specific, forecastable questions and provided research context.\n\n**Step 4: Operationalize this question**\nI took the first sub-question: \"Will the European Commission's Autumn 2025 Economic Forecast revise the EU's 2026 real GDP growth forecast downwards by at least 0.2 percentage points compared to the Spring 2025 forecast (1.4% for Eurozone, 1.5% for EU), explicitly citing \"trade uncertainty,\" \"tariffs,\" or \"protectionism\" as a primary reason?\" and operationalized it into a detailed, binary forecast question.\n\n**Step 5: Forecast the question**\nI successfully forecasted the operationalized question. The final prediction is **60.0% probability** that the European Commission's Autumn 2025 Economic Forecast will revise the EU's 2026 real GDP growth forecast downwards by at least 0.2 percentage points compared to the Spring 2025 forecast, explicitly citing trade uncertainty as a contributing factor.\n\nThe research indicates that the European Commission has already revised growth projections downward for 2025 and 2026 in its Spring 2025 forecast due to global trade tensions, particularly US tariffs. The EU's 2026 growth forecast was revised from 1.8% down to 1.5% in the Spring. For the question to resolve as \"Yes,\" a further downward revision to 1.3% or lower in the Autumn 2025 forecast, with trade uncertainty explicitly cited, would be needed. Forecasters believe there is a 60% chance of this occurring.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?",
