It posits that if a new product category (MLB game contracts) demonstrates significant user adoption, Kalshi might be incentivized to expand into other major sports leagues.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** Specific conditional questions like this rarely have direct past resolutions. However, Kalshi's general expansion strategy has involved launching new market categories over time (e.g., MLB game markets in April 2025).\n\n### Questions for the 1-Year Horizon (by May 20, 2026)\n\n1.  **Will Polymarket announce any new partnerships with traditional financial institutions (e.g., banks, investment firms) or major regulated media outlets (e.g., established newspapers with national circulation, major television news networks) via its official blog or primary X (Twitter) feed by May 20, 2026?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Review Polymarket's official blog and primary official X (Twitter) feed for any announcements of new partnerships fitting the criteria between May 21, 2025, and May 20, 2026.\n    *   **Background Information:** Partnerships with established financial institutions or major regulated media could signify mainstream adoption or increased regulatory comfort for Polymarket.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** Between May 20, 2024, and May 20, 2025, Polymarket announced a partnership with Perplexity (an AI search engine, not a traditional financial institution or regulated media outlet) in August 2024 (Source: TechCrunch, [https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/prediction-market-polymarket-partners-with-perplexity-to-show-news-summaries/](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/prediction-market-polymarket-partners-with-perplexity-to-show-news-summaries/)).\n\n2.  **By May 20, 2026, will Kalshi introduce and feature on its main platform at least two new *distinct event contract categories* that are not primarily sub-categories of its existing 12 categories listed as of May 20, 2025?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** On May 20, 2026, review the categories of event contracts listed on Kalshi's official website. Compare this to the 12 categories listed as of May 20, 2025 (Politics, Sports, Culture, Crypto, Climate, Economics, Companies, Financials, Tech & Science, Health, World, Transportation).\n    *   **Background Information:** The introduction of new event categories reflects Kalshi's growth strategy and expansion into new forecasting areas.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** As of May 20, 2025, Kalshi listed 12 distinct categories. The number of top-level categories appeared stable from May 2024 to May 2025.\n\n3.  **Between May 21, 2025, and May 20, 2026, will either The Block Crypto or Cointelegraph publish an article confirming a security breach leading to a direct loss of user funds, or a regulatory shutdown ordering cessation of services, specifically for a prediction market platform that had a self-reported or independently estimated total annual trading volume exceeding $5 million USD in the 12 months prior to the event?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** On May 21, 2026, search the websites of The Block Crypto and Cointelegraph for articles published between May 21, 2025, and May 20, 2026, using relevant keywords.\n    *   **Background Information:** This question gauges the operational and regulatory stability of larger prediction market platforms.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** Based on a search for the period May 20, 2024, to May 20, 2025, no articles were found detailing such an event for a prediction market platform meeting the volume criteria.\n\n4.  **By May 20, 2026, will the official websites of Good Judgment Inc. (goodjudgment.com) or Hypermind (hypermind.com) collectively feature at least one new publicly accessible case study or whitepaper that explicitly names a company from the S&P 100 list (as of January 1, 2025) as a client or details a project undertaken with them?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** On May 20, 2026, review the \"Case Studies,\" \"Resources,\" \"Clients,\" or similar sections on goodjudgment.com and hypermind.com. Compare the list of case studies/whitepapers featuring named S&P 100 companies to those available on May 20, 2025.\n    *   **Background Information:** Adoption by S&P 100 companies, showcased publicly, would indicate growing corporate trust in these judgemental forecasting services.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** As of May 20, 2025, neither Good Judgment Inc. nor Hypermind explicitly listed case studies or whitepapers featuring named S&P 100 companies on their public websites. (Source: Good Judgment Case Studies page [https://goodjudgment.com/resources/case-studies/](https://goodjudgment.com/resources/case-studies/)).\n\n5.  **If a prediction market platform's native utility token (not previously listed on Kraken) gets newly listed for trading on Kraken by November 20, 2025, will its average daily trading volume across all exchanges in the 30 days *following* the Kraken listing be at least 50% greater than its average daily trading volume in the 30 days *prior* to the Kraken listing announcement?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Monitor announcements from Kraken and prediction market platforms for new listings. If such a listing occurs, use a reputable crypto data aggregator (e.g., CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko) to find the token's historical daily trading volume. Calculate the average daily volume for the 30 days immediately preceding the listing announcement and the 30 days starting from the listing date. Compare the two averages.\n    *   **Background Information:** Listing on a major exchange like Kraken can significantly increase a token's visibility and trading volume. This question explores the \"exchange listing effect\" for prediction market tokens.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** For a comparable example, Flux (FLUX) was listed on Binance on December 10, 2021. One would access historical data from CoinMarketCap (e.g., [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zel/flux/historical-data/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zel/flux/historical-data/)) or CoinGecko for the relevant periods to calculate the percentage change in average daily volume.\n\nI hope these questions are helpful for your forecasting efforts!

For the Eurozone, the growth is expected to be 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, a decrease from earlier forecasts of 1.3% and 1.6%. The report highlights that the downward revisions are significantly influenced by a weakening global trade outlook and the high levels of uncertainty related to trade policy, particularly due to new tariffs imposed by the US.\n\nEuropean Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis emphasized that the EU economy, while starting the year on a stronger footing than expected, is facing challenges from global uncertainties that are weighing on growth.

The overall economic environment remains fragile, with risks oriented downwards, and the Commission urges decisive actions to enhance the EU's competitiveness in light of these challenges.\n\nSources:\n- [HABERTURK.COM](https://www.haberturk.com/ab-2025-yili-ekonomik-buyume-tahminini-dusurdu-3792233-ekonomi)\n- [birgun.net](https://www.birgun.net/haber/ab-komisyonu-2025-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize-etti-624219)\n- [ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/05/19/o-momento-da-europa-para-agir-e-agora/)\n- [Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/economia/news/dazi_ue_riduce_stime_pil_cosa_succede-8845536.html)\n- [ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/economia/2025/05/19/lue-taglia-la-stima-sul-pil-dellitalia-07-nel-2025-09-nel-2026_d384818e-bb75-476c-ae45-3af09b0e9117.html)\n\n\n# RESEARCH\n## Report 1 Research\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**EU Economic Growth Projections Revised Downward**\nThe European Commission's 'European Economic Projections 2025 Spring' report has been published. According to the report, despite global economic uncertainty, the EU economy has started the year on a stronger footing than expected, with moderate growth expected to continue this year, and a slight acceleration in growth expected in 2026, despite increasing global policy uncertainty and trade tensions. The report forecasts that the EU economy will grow by 1.1% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, while the Eurozone economy is expected to grow by 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. This is a downward revision of the Commission's previous 'autumn' report, which forecasted growth of 1.5% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026 for the EU, and 1.3% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026 for the Eurozone. The report states, 'The current forecast has been significantly revised downwards, mainly due to the weakening global trade outlook and high uncertainty related to trade policy.'\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 12:43 PM\nSource:[HABERTURK.COM](https://www.haberturk.com/ab-2025-yili-ekonomik-buyume-tahminini-dusurdu-3792233-ekonomi)\n\n**European Commission Revises 2025 and 2026 Growth Forecasts Downward**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 downward due to global trade tensions and increasing uncertainties. The growth forecast for the Eurozone has been revised from 1.3% to 0.9% for this year, while inflation is expected to continue its downward trend. The European Commission's '2025 Spring European Economic Forecasts' report states that the EU's economy is stronger than expected at the beginning of the year, but global trade tensions and uncertainties are slowing down growth. The report predicts that the EU's economy will grow by 1.1% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. For the Eurozone, the growth rate is expected to be 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. This is a significant decrease from the previous forecast of 1.3% and 1.6%. The revision is attributed to the slowdown in global trade flows and high levels of ongoing trade policy uncertainty. According to the report, Austria's economy is expected to shrink by 0.3% in 2025, while Germany's economy is expected to remain stagnant. France is expected to grow by 0.6%, Italy by 0.7%, and Spain by 2.6% in 2025, while in 2026, Germany is expected to grow by 1.1%, France by 1.3%, Italy by 0.9%, and Spain by 2%. Inflation is expected to be 2.3% in 2025 for the EU and 2.1% for the Eurozone, while in 2026, these rates are expected to decrease to 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively. The report also notes that the US's new tariffs have had a significant impact on global markets, and that the uncertainty surrounding trade policies has increased the pressure on the global economy, affecting the EU directly. The report concludes that the EU's exports will be slowed down by the global demand weakness, and that the trade tensions will continue to have a negative impact on the EU's economy. The report also warns that the commercial fragmentation can have negative effects on growth and that there is a risk of re-emerging inflationary pressures. The report also mentions Turkey's economy, stating that the country's economy is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2025 and 3.5% in 2026, due to the effects of tight monetary and fiscal policies, as well as the decline in energy prices. The report also predicts that Turkey's budget deficit will decrease and its public debt will remain at a reasonable level. European Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis stated in a press conference in Brussels that the European economy is resilient despite the increasing global uncertainties. He also stated that inflation has declined faster than expected and that growth will continue at a moderate pace. He warned that the risks are still downward and that the EU needs to take decisive steps to increase its competitiveness. 'The outlook is still subject to risks, and therefore, we need to take bold steps to increase our competitiveness within the EU.' he said. \nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 12:36 PM\nSource:[birgun.net](https://www.birgun.net/haber/ab-komisyonu-2025-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize-etti-624219)\n\n**EU Economy Losing Steam, Commissioner Warns**\nValdis Dombrovskis, European Commissioner for Economy, stated that the European economy is losing steam and that only swift action can prevent the EU from lagging behind global growth. The European Commission has revised down its growth forecasts for the European economy, in a scenario marked by global uncertainty and trade tensions, particularly with the US. 'Global uncertainty and tensions are weighing on the growth of the European Union', said Dombrovskis, highlighting that, despite the challenges, 'the European economy remains resilient'. The Commission now expects the EU's GDP to grow by only 1.1% in 2025, a downward revision of 0.7 percentage points from the previously forecast 1.5%, and projects an acceleration to 1.5% in 2026. In the Eurozone, growth will be 0.9% this year, rising to 1.4% next year. 'This downward revision of 0.7 percentage points in accumulated terms for 2025-26 is mainly due to the impact of the tariff increase and the uncertainty caused by the abrupt changes in US commercial policy', explained Dombrovskis. The Commissioner warned that 'tensions in trade between the US and the EU, and between the US and China, can depress GDP growth and rekindle inflationary pressures'. On the other hand, 'a relaxation of trade tensions or a faster expansion of EU trade can help sustain growth'. Dombrovskis emphasized that 'the moment for the EU to act is now.' The Commissioner pointed out that 'the deterioration of global trade as a central element of the cut in EU and global GDP growth forecasts.' 'The global growth outside the EU is now projected at 3.2% for 2025 and 2026, a downward revision of 0.4 percentage points from the autumn', revealed Dombrovskis. Despite the slowdown, the European labor market remains robust. 'More jobs are being created and real wages are rising. This means more Europeans working and more money in their pockets', said the Commissioner. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a new historical low of 5.7% in 2026, with the creation of an additional two million jobs by then. 'Tight labor markets and productivity recovery are supporting wage growth', he said, adding that 'real wages are expected to fully recover the lost purchasing power in most member states'. Inflation is decelerating more rapidly than expected in the European space, Dombrovskis noted. 'Inflation is falling faster than expected, driven by the decline in energy prices', he indicated, detailing that the rate in the euro area is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026. In the EU, inflation is expected to follow a similar trajectory, falling to 1.9% in 2026. 'Several factors are exerting downward pressure on inflation, including the appreciation of the euro and increased price competition in non-energy goods', he explained. On the investment side, the recovery will be 'more timid than expected', with gross fixed capital formation growing 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, after a contraction of 1.9% in 2024. 'High uncertainty and tight financial conditions continue to hold back investment', warned Dombrovskis, arguing that 'more investment means a more prosperous and competitive European economy'. In the chapter on public finances, the EU's budget deficit is expected to increase slightly to 3.3% of GDP in 2025, remaining at that level in 2026, while the debt ratio rises modestly due to the increase in financing costs and the slowdown in nominal growth. However, Dombrovskis clarified that 'the impact of the application of the national escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact, which can allow for greater expenditure in defense, is not yet reflected in the forecasts', he clarified.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 11:29 AM\nSource:[ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/05/19/o-momento-da-europa-para-agir-e-agora/)\n\n**EU Economic Growth Forecast Revised Downwards to 0.9% in 2025**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth forecast for the Eurozone to 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, down from 1.3% and 1.6% respectively in the previous forecast. The Commission attributes this to the weakening of global trade prospects and increased uncertainty over trade policies. 'The risks for the prospects are oriented downwards', says the European Commission. The Commission also notes that an additional fragmentation of global trade could mitigate economic growth and rekindle inflationary pressures. On the positive side, a further easing of tensions between the EU and the US or a faster expansion of EU trade with other countries could support EU growth. The EU economy has started 2025 on a slightly more solid basis than expected, according to the Commission, and will continue to grow at a moderate pace this year, with an acceleration expected in 2026, despite the increase in global economic uncertainty and trade tensions. Inflation is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026 in the euro area. The EU's economic growth is expected to be similar, with a decline in inflation to just under 2% in 2026. The EU economy has recorded a growth of 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, above expectations, thanks to internal demand. This momentum has continued into the first quarter of 2025 (+0.3%). However, current forecasts revise downwards the growth prospects due to the worsening of global trade and political uncertainty. The global growth outside the EU is expected to be 3.2% in 2025-2026, down from 3.6% estimated in autumn. EU exports are expected to grow only 0.7% this year, driven by services. Investments, in a slight recovery after -1.8% in 2024, are expected to increase by 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, supported also by the Recovery Fund and the Cohesion Fund. Private consumption is expected to grow by 1.5% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. The labor market remains solid: 1.7 million jobs created in 2024, with an additional 2 million expected. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a historic low of 5.7% in 2026. Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said, 'The uncertainty on the global economic policy has reached levels never seen since the Covid-19 pandemic.' He added, 'The logic behind the US announcements on tariffs is unpredictable and apparently arbitrary, and has led to unprecedented levels of uncertainty on the global economic policy.' 'Since January, the new US administration has increased tariffs on imports from an increasing number of partner countries and on specific goods. The average tariff rate applied by the US on imports is today higher than at any other time since the 1930s.' 'The US announcements in April have also caused very high levels of market volatility. This market volatility remains high and the sentiment is fragile, as a great uncertainty on US trade and economic policy still looms,' he concluded.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 10:47 AM\nSource:[Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/economia/news/dazi_ue_riduce_stime_pil_cosa_succede-8845536.html)\n\n**European Commission Revises Down Economic Growth Forecasts for Eurozone**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth forecasts for the Eurozone downwards.

The EU's public deficit is expected to rise slightly to 3.3% in 2025-2026. The debt is expected to rise to 83.2% of GDP in 2025 and 84.5% in 2026. The Commission has also revised its growth forecast for Germany, predicting 0% growth this year (after a decline of 0.2% in 2024) and 1.1% growth in 2026, down from 0.7% growth this year and 1.3% growth next year. The Commission attributes this revision to weak exports, weak consumption, global uncertainty and unfavorable financial conditions.

The main reasons for the revision are the new import tariffs and increased uncertainty caused by the rapid changes in US trade policy. According to the report, the EU's GDP growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2025, down from the previous forecast of 1.5%. The forecast for 2026 has also been revised downward to 1.5% from 1.8%. However, the Commission expects the economic growth of the EU to accelerate to 1.5% in 2026, driven by an increase in consumption and investment. The inflation rate is expected to decrease faster than previously forecast, with consumer prices (HICP index) increasing by 2.3% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. The economy of the eurozone is expected to grow by 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, down from the previous forecasts of 1.3% and 1.6%.

The Commission stated, 'This represents a considerable downward revision compared to the autumn 2024 projections, largely due to the impact of the tariff increase and the greater uncertainty caused by the recent abrupt changes in US commercial policy and the unpredictability of the final tariff configuration.'

The growth forecast for the Eurozone has been revised from 1.3% to 0.9% for this year, while inflation is expected to continue its downward trend. The European Commission's '2025 Spring European Economic Forecasts' report states that the EU's economy is stronger than expected at the beginning of the year, but global trade tensions and uncertainties are slowing down growth. The report predicts that the EU's economy will grow by 1.1% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. For the Eurozone, the growth rate is expected to be 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. This is a significant decrease from the previous forecast of 1.3% and 1.6%. The revision is attributed to the slowdown in global trade flows and high levels of ongoing trade policy uncertainty. According to the report, Austria's economy is expected to shrink by 0.3% in 2025, while Germany's economy is expected to remain stagnant. France is expected to grow by 0.6%, Italy by 0.7%, and Spain by 2.6% in 2025, while in 2026, Germany is expected to grow by 1.1%, France by 1.3%, Italy by 0.9%, and Spain by 2%. Inflation is expected to be 2.3% in 2025 for the EU and 2.1% for the Eurozone, while in 2026, these rates are expected to decrease to 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively. The report also notes that the US's new tariffs have had a significant impact on global markets, and that the uncertainty surrounding trade policies has increased the pressure on the global economy, affecting the EU directly. The report concludes that the EU's exports will be slowed down by the global demand weakness, and that the trade tensions will continue to have a negative impact on the EU's economy. The report also warns that the commercial fragmentation can have negative effects on growth and that there is a risk of re-emerging inflationary pressures. The report also mentions Turkey's economy, stating that the country's economy is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2025 and 3.5% in 2026, due to the effects of tight monetary and fiscal policies, as well as the decline in energy prices. The report also predicts that Turkey's budget deficit will decrease and its public debt will remain at a reasonable level. European Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis stated in a press conference in Brussels that the European economy is resilient despite the increasing global uncertainties. He also stated that inflation has declined faster than expected and that growth will continue at a moderate pace. He warned that the risks are still downward and that the EU needs to take decisive steps to increase its competitiveness. 'The outlook is still subject to risks, and therefore, we need to take bold steps to increase our competitiveness within the EU.' he said. \nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 12:36 PM\nSource:[birgun.net](https://www.birgun.net/haber/ab-komisyonu-2025-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize-etti-624219)\n\n**EU Economy Losing Steam, Commissioner Warns**\nValdis Dombrovskis, European Commissioner for Economy, stated that the European economy is losing steam and that only swift action can prevent the EU from lagging behind global growth. The European Commission has revised down its growth forecasts for the European economy, in a scenario marked by global uncertainty and trade tensions, particularly with the US. 'Global uncertainty and tensions are weighing on the growth of the European Union', said Dombrovskis, highlighting that, despite the challenges, 'the European economy remains resilient'. The Commission now expects the EU's GDP to grow by only 1.1% in 2025, a downward revision of 0.7 percentage points from the previously forecast 1.5%, and projects an acceleration to 1.5% in 2026. In the Eurozone, growth will be 0.9% this year, rising to 1.4% next year. 'This downward revision of 0.7 percentage points in accumulated terms for 2025-26 is mainly due to the impact of the tariff increase and the uncertainty caused by the abrupt changes in US commercial policy', explained Dombrovskis. The Commissioner warned that 'tensions in trade between the US and the EU, and between the US and China, can depress GDP growth and rekindle inflationary pressures'. On the other hand, 'a relaxation of trade tensions or a faster expansion of EU trade can help sustain growth'. Dombrovskis emphasized that 'the moment for the EU to act is now.' The Commissioner pointed out that 'the deterioration of global trade as a central element of the cut in EU and global GDP growth forecasts.' 'The global growth outside the EU is now projected at 3.2% for 2025 and 2026, a downward revision of 0.4 percentage points from the autumn', revealed Dombrovskis. Despite the slowdown, the European labor market remains robust. 'More jobs are being created and real wages are rising. This means more Europeans working and more money in their pockets', said the Commissioner. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a new historical low of 5.7% in 2026, with the creation of an additional two million jobs by then. 'Tight labor markets and productivity recovery are supporting wage growth', he said, adding that 'real wages are expected to fully recover the lost purchasing power in most member states'. Inflation is decelerating more rapidly than expected in the European space, Dombrovskis noted. 'Inflation is falling faster than expected, driven by the decline in energy prices', he indicated, detailing that the rate in the euro area is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026. In the EU, inflation is expected to follow a similar trajectory, falling to 1.9% in 2026. 'Several factors are exerting downward pressure on inflation, including the appreciation of the euro and increased price competition in non-energy goods', he explained. On the investment side, the recovery will be 'more timid than expected', with gross fixed capital formation growing 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, after a contraction of 1.9% in 2024. 'High uncertainty and tight financial conditions continue to hold back investment', warned Dombrovskis, arguing that 'more investment means a more prosperous and competitive European economy'. In the chapter on public finances, the EU's budget deficit is expected to increase slightly to 3.3% of GDP in 2025, remaining at that level in 2026, while the debt ratio rises modestly due to the increase in financing costs and the slowdown in nominal growth. However, Dombrovskis clarified that 'the impact of the application of the national escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact, which can allow for greater expenditure in defense, is not yet reflected in the forecasts', he clarified.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 11:29 AM\nSource:[ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/05/19/o-momento-da-europa-para-agir-e-agora/)\n\n**EU Economic Growth Forecast Revised Downwards to 0.9% in 2025**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth forecast for the Eurozone to 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, down from 1.3% and 1.6% respectively in the previous forecast.

The Commission attributes the downward revision to the weakening of global trade prospects and increased uncertainty over commercial policies. The Commission also expects the Italian deficit to continue to decline, from 3.4% of GDP in 2024 to 3.3% in 2025 and 2.9% in 2026. However, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase, reaching 136.7% in 2025 and 138.2% in 2026. 'The economy is showing resilience despite the strong commercial tensions and the increase in global uncertainty,' said EU Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis. 'We expect the growth to continue in 2025, albeit at a moderate pace. Inflation is decreasing more rapidly than previously expected and is on track to reach the 2% target this year. However, we cannot lower our guard. The risks for the prospects remain oriented downward, so the EU must adopt decisive measures to strengthen our competitiveness.'\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 09:49 AM\nSource:[Il Fatto Quotidiano](https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2025/05/19/commissione-europea-stime-crescita-italia-notizie/7993760/)\n\n**EU Economic Forecasts: Growth Prospects Revised Downward**\nThe European Commission has released its economic forecasts, which show a significant downward revision of growth prospects. The EU economy grew by 0.4% in the last quarter of 2024, driven by a robust internal demand. However, the first quarter of 2025 saw a growth of only 0.3% in real GDP. The Commission's spring forecasts are based on some assumptions about tariffs. 'In the model, it was assumed that the tariffs on US imports of goods from the EU and almost all other trading partners would remain at 10%, the level applied on April 9, except for the higher tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars (25%) and the tariff exemptions on some products (pharmaceuticals and microprocessors). It was assumed that the bilateral tariffs between the US and China would be lower than those applied on April 9, but high enough to lead to a significant reduction in bilateral trade in goods between the US and China. The tariffs agreed upon by China and the US on May 12 turned out to be lower than those assumed, but still high enough to not invalidate the assumption of a negative impact on trade relations between the US and China.' As a result, global growth outside the EU is now expected to be 3.2% for both 2025 and 2026, down from the 3.6% expected in the autumn of 2024. 'This downward revision reflects in large part a weakening of prospects for both the US and China. The slowdown in global trade is even more marked.' Consequently, the Commission expects EU exports to grow only 0.7% this year, with a new contraction in goods exports partially offset by the resilience of service exports, which are less influenced by trade tensions. In 2026, export growth is expected to accelerate to 2.1%. The uncertainty of tariffs also weighs on internal demand and investment. 'As for private consumption, a slightly more robust growth is expected than in the autumn', supported 'by a still resilient labor market.'\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 09:09 AM\nSource:[SIR - Servizio Informazione Religiosa](https://www.agensir.it/quotidiano/2025/5/19/commissione-ue-previsioni-economiche-prospettive-peggiorate-i-dazi-pesano-sul-commercio-internazionale/)\n\n**EU Trade Commissioner: EU's Economic Growth Forecast Remains Pessimistic**\nEuropean Commission Executive Vice President and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis stated that the recent trade truce between the US and China, which involves a mutual reduction of tariffs, is a step in the right direction, but the high tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese products still pose a significant risk. The EU has been concerned that China may divert its exports from the US to the EU due to the high tariffs, which could have a negative impact on the EU's economic growth and investment prospects. Dombrovskis emphasized that the EU's economic growth forecast for this year remains pessimistic due to the uncertainty caused by the US tariffs. The EU will release its spring economic forecast on May 19, which is expected to revise downward its GDP growth forecast for this year. The EU's previous forecast in autumn last year predicted a 0.9% GDP growth rate for this year and 1.5% for next year. However, the forecast is expected to be revised downward due to the impact of US tariffs.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 13, 2025 11:32 PM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E5%9B%BD%E9%99%85/20250513-%E6%AC%A7%E7%9B%9F%E8%B4%B8%E6%98%93%E4%B8%93%E5%91%98-%E6%AC%A7%E7%9B%9F%E4%BB%8A%E5%B9%B4%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E%E5%A2%9E%E9%95%BF%E9%A2%84%E6%9C%9F%E4%BB%8D%E6%82%B2%E8%A7%82)\n\n**EU Economic Growth Forecast Revised Down Amid US Tariffs Concerns**\nThe European Commission's Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis has expressed optimism about the US-China trade truce, saying it is a step in the right direction, but notes that US tariffs remain high, which will likely lead to a pessimistic economic growth forecast for this year. The European Commission will release its spring economic forecast data next Monday, and Dombrovskis has announced that it will revise down its annual economic growth rate forecast for this year. The Commission's economic predictions are released twice a year, and last autumn's prediction was a 0.9% growth rate for the EU's GDP in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025. However, due to the impact of US tariffs, the prediction will be significantly revised. Dombrovskis said that the EU economy had a stronger foundation at the end of last year than initially expected, and maintained its momentum at the beginning of this year, but US tariffs and the uncertainty they bring will have a negative impact on the EU's economic growth and investment prospects this year. He also noted that the EU's concerns about trade diversion, where countries may shift their exports from the US to the EU due to high US tariffs, have been slightly alleviated by the US-China trade truce, but the risk remains, and the Commission has announced that it will release a report on trade diversion risks in May.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 13, 2025 04:18 PM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5599/8738001)\n\n**IMF Downgrades Global Economic Forecast Due to Trade Tensions and Political Uncertainty**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its forecast for the global economy downward, citing the impact of trade tensions and high levels of political uncertainty. The IMF predicts that the global GDP will grow at 2.8% in 2025 and 3% in 2026, down from the previous forecast of 3.3% for both years. This represents a revision of five-tenths of a percentage point downward for this year and three-tenths of a percentage point for next year. The IMF notes that the rapid escalation of trade tensions and extremely high levels of political uncertainty will have a significant impact on the global economy. The US economy is expected to grow at 1.8% in 2025, down from the previous forecast of 2.7%, due to the impact of tariffs and a weaker-than-expected increase in consumption. The IMF also reduced its forecast for China's GDP, predicting a growth rate of 4% in 2025 and 2026, down from the previous forecast of 5% and 5.3% respectively. The IMF also reduced its forecast for the eurozone, predicting a growth rate of 0.8% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026. However, the IMF notes that the Spanish economy is expected to grow at 2.5% in 2025, up from the previous forecast of 2.3%, due to a strong performance in 2024 and the reconstruction efforts after the floods in Valencia last October. 'The increase in uncertainty and tariffs are the main drivers of the weak growth in 2025', said the IMF. 'However, there are several factors that will compensate for that scenario and drive the modest rebound in growth in 2026, such as a stronger consumption due to the increase in real wages and the relaxation of fiscal rules in Germany.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: April 22, 2025 01:00 PM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/invertia/economia/macroeconomia/20250422/fmi-aplica-gran-recorte-economia-baja-decimas-pib-mundial-eeuu-solo-mejora-espana/1003743723998_0.html)\n\n**UK Downgrades 2025 Economic Growth Forecast to 1%**\nThe UK government has significantly lowered its economic growth forecast for 2025 to 1%, a drastic cut from the 2% prediction made in October last year. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) attributed the downward revision to increased global economic uncertainty, rising energy prices, higher government debt costs, and sluggish domestic productivity growth. UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak expressed dissatisfaction with the current economic growth data, emphasizing that the government will continue to implement long-term strategies to promote economic growth and improve living standards. The OBR predicts that the UK's economic growth rate will rebound to 1.9% in 2026, followed by a steady 1.7% to 1.8% growth rate from 2027 to 2029. The OBR also warned that uncertainty surrounding US trade policies could significantly impact the UK economy. If global trade disputes escalate and lead to a 20% increase in tariffs between the US and Europe, the UK's GDP could contract by 1%, resulting in a near-zero fiscal surplus.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 26, 2025 10:31 PM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202503273357173521.html)\n\n**OECD revises global economic growth forecast downward**\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has revised its forecast for global economic growth, predicting a slowdown from 3.2% in 2024 to 3.1% in 2025 and 3.0% in 2026. The OECD attributed the downward revision to 'increased trade barriers in several G20 economies and greater geopolitical and policy uncertainty weighing on investment and household spending.' The organization warned that a further increase in trade barriers would hinder global growth and contribute to inflationary pressures. According to the OECD, the US economy is expected to grow at 2.2% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026, with the implementation of tariffs. The eurozone is expected to grow at 1% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026, with increased uncertainty moderating the expansion. Germany, France, and Italy are expected to experience economic growth below 1% in 2025, while Spain is expected to grow at 2.6% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. The OECD also expects inflation to remain higher than previously anticipated, but to moderate as economic growth slows. In the G20 economies, inflation is expected to decrease from 3.8% in 2025 to 3.2% in 2026. In the eurozone, inflation is expected to decrease from 2.3% in 2024 to 2.2% in 2025 and 2% in 2026. However, in the US, inflation is expected to increase from 2.5% in 2024 to 2.8% in 2025. The OECD warned that a resurgence of inflation or slower-than-expected economic growth could generate volatility in financial markets. It also warned that new bilateral tariffs and increasing geopolitical and policy uncertainty would weigh on business investment and trade, while the increase in trade costs could exert greater upward pressure on consumer prices. 'Growing protectionism, geopolitical uncertainty, and weak growth prospects reinforce the need for ambitious structural reforms to ensure the health of internal markets,' the OECD added.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 12:28 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u534e\u7f51](http://spanish.xinhuanet.com/20250318/6d14e583b4914a6a8567a3552912cf1a/c.html)\n\n**OECD revises global economic growth forecast downward for 2025**\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has revised its forecast for global economic growth in 2025 downward, citing uncertainty and tensions in the global economy. 'We are navigating turbulent waters', said Alvaro Santos Pereira, the OECD's chief economist, summarizing the global economic situation. The OECD now predicts a 3.1% growth in the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2025, down from its previous forecast of 3.3% in December. The United States, which has threatened to engage in a trade war with its main trading partners, is expected to grow by 2.2% this year and 1.6% next year, according to the OECD. The organization has lowered its forecast for US economic growth in 2025 and 2026 by 0.2 and 0.5 percentage points, respectively. The aggressive trade policies pursued by the US are particularly affecting its neighbors, Canada and Mexico, whose growth forecasts have plummeted: Canada's growth is expected to be 0.7% in 2025, down from 2.3% in December, while Mexico is expected to enter a recession this year, according to the OECD. The OECD attributes the downward revision to the ongoing trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties affecting many countries. The OECD notes that the growth in the US, Mexico, and Canada 'will slow down as tariffs come into effect'. The organization has only taken into account the new tariffs between the US, Canada, and Mexico, as well as the tariffs on steel and aluminum, but not the threatened reciprocal tariffs mentioned by Trump or those related to the European Union. Despite this, the OECD has revised its growth forecast for 2025 downward for Germany and France, the largest and second-largest economies in the eurozone, for the second consecutive time. The OECD now expects Germany's GDP to grow by 0.4% this year, down from 0.7% in its previous forecast, while France's growth is expected to be 0.8% this year, 0.1 percentage points less than in December. 'European economies will suffer fewer direct economic effects' from the trade measures included in the OECD's projections, 'but the increase in geopolitical and political uncertainty should, nonetheless, slow down growth', explains the organization. Only Spain is expected to experience sustained growth, with a forecast of 2.6% in 2025. Japan's growth forecast for 2025 has also been revised downward to 1.1%, a 0.4 percentage point decrease. China's growth is expected to reach 4.8% in 2025, with little change from the December forecast. 'The negative consequences of the imposition of tariffs are largely offset by the adoption of reinforced support measures', notes the OECD. The OECD warns of the negative impact of trade tensions on global trade, which could not only slow down global production but also exacerbate inflation.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 11:55 AM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/agencias/2025/03/17/la-ocde-revisa-a-la-baja-el-crecimiento-mundial-en-2025-en-un-contexto-de-tensiones-comerciales-208735)\n\n**ECB's Macroeconomic Projections for the Euro Area: Uncertainty and Challenges Ahead**\nAccording to the European Central Bank's (ECB) macroeconomic projections for the euro area, the high uncertainty surrounding the geopolitical situation and economic and trade policies will negatively impact the expected economic growth. This is a consequence of the slightly weaker-than-expected economic growth at the end of 2024. The uncertainty related to both internal and external policies is high. Although the baseline projections only take into account the impact of new US-China trade tariffs, it is assumed that the negative effects of uncertainty related to possible further changes in global trade policies, especially towards the European Union, will affect exports and investments in the euro area. It is estimated that, combined with the ongoing challenges in terms of competitiveness, this will lead to a further decline in the euro area's share of export markets. Despite these unfavorable factors, the conditions remain in place for a renewed increase in the dynamics of GDP in the euro area in the projection horizon. It is expected that the growth will be driven by rising real wages and employment growth - with a strong, albeit slowing, labor market - and that consumption will remain a key driver of growth. The internal demand is expected to support the easing of financing conditions, reflected in market expectations of the future path of interest rates. The labor market is expected to remain resilient - with an average unemployment rate of 6.3% in 2025, followed by a decline to 6.2% in 2027. It is projected that productivity will grow in line with the fading of some cyclical factors that have weakened its dynamics in recent periods. However, structural problems persist. Overall, the average annual growth rate of real GDP is expected to be 0.9% in 2025, followed by an increase to 1.2% in 2026 and 1.3% in 2027. Compared to the ECB's macroeconomic projections from December 2024, the prospects for GDP growth in 2025 and 2026 have been revised down by 0.2 percentage points, but the 2027 projection remains unchanged. The weaker prospects are mainly due to a downward revision of exports and, to a lesser extent, a downward revision of investment projections. These revisions reflect the stronger-than-expected impact of uncertainty and expectations that the challenges related to competitiveness will persist longer than previously expected. \nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/projections/html/ecb.projections202503_ecbstaff~106050a4fa.pl.html)\n\n**Lagarde: Economic Uncertainty Weighs on Exports and Investments**\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde stated, 'The downward revisions to the euro area's GDP growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 reflect the decline in exports and the continued weakness in investments, partly due to the high uncertainty surrounding commercial and economic policies.'

European Commissioner for Trade, Valdis Dombrovskis, warned that the international environment is becoming increasingly unpredictable. 'In general, we expect the EU economy to grow at a slower pace compared to what we projected in our autumn forecast', he said. The EU had previously forecasted a 0.9% growth in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025, but according to Eurostat, the actual growth rate is expected to be 0.9% in 2024. Dombrovskis emphasized that the uncertainty is 'high' and has increased significantly, particularly due to US trade policies, which 'limits investment and reduces external perspectives' for the European economy. He also noted that energy prices have increased again in recent months, affecting the economy's performance. 'However, despite all these challenges, the conditions for a gradual recovery of growth momentum throughout this year continue', he said. The Commissioner urged the Eurozone to prepare for an increasingly unpredictable international environment. 'We will need to make full use of our strengths and address our weaknesses with the utmost urgency. We will have to take more responsibility for our security and defense and improve our competitiveness and economic fundamentals', he listed. The European Commissioner also indicated that the Finance Ministers of the Eurozone countries have endorsed the fiscal orientation that should guide the member states. 'This year's recommendation emphasizes the urgent need to address the lagging productivity and innovation, highlighting the importance of continuing our efforts to increase the competitiveness of the Eurozone', he stressed. The recommendation also places a strong emphasis on the need to strengthen the Single Market.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 08:15 PM\nSource:[ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/02/17/mais-pessimista-sobre-crescimento-bruxelas-avisa-para-ambiente-internacional-imprevisivel/)\n\n**Eurozone Growth Predictions Revised Downward**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth predictions for the eurozone, stating that growth will be slightly lower than previously expected.

Pierre Gramegna, executive director of the European Stability Mechanism, noted that tariffs would make predictions even more unpredictable. The Commission has not released specific numbers, but estimates suggest a potential 0.1-0.2% decrease in growth for the EU and eurozone.

Even if trade tensions are mentioned, the numerical criterion would not be satisfied.  \n(d) A plausible \u201cYes\u201d scenario: We see mounting trade disruptions, enough for the Commission to cut the 2026 outlook to 1.3% (or below), explicitly citing ongoing tariff and policy uncertainty as part of the rationale.  \n\nGiven that forecasts often move gradually, and 0.2% is a moderate but not huge shift, the probability that both conditions are met is neither negligible nor overwhelming. After weighing present uncertainties and the Commission\u2019s stated concerns about trade tensions, I estimate:  \n\nProbability: 60%  \n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 3 Reasoning\n(a) Time left until we know: Around six months remain, as the Autumn 2025 Forecast is typically released in November.  \n(b) Status quo outcome: Right now, the Commission\u2019s baseline for 2026 is still 1.5% growth, with trade tensions acknowledged but not yet prompting a downward revision below 1.3%.  \n(c) A likely No scenario: The Commission revises 2026 growth modestly downward (e.g., 1.4%), or fails to list trade uncertainty among the primary reasons for the revision, so the 0.2 percentage-point drop and explicit mention of trade risk do not both materialize.  \n(d) A likely Yes scenario: Global trade frictions deepen (e.g., further tariff escalations), prompting the Commission to cut the 2026 forecast to 1.3% or below and explicitly cite these heightened trade risks as a key factor driving the revision.  \n\nProbability: 65%  \n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 4 Reasoning\n(a) The Autumn 2025 forecast is typically released in early November, so there are about five to six months left before we know the official outcome.\n\n(b) Currently, the Commission\u2019s 2026 forecast stands at 1.5%. If nothing significant changes in trade policy or the broader outlook, the Commission might leave it at 1.5% or revise only slightly above 1.3%, and/or not explicitly cite trade uncertainty as a key reason.\n\n(c) A scenario yielding a No: Trade frictions calm down or remain marginal, so the EU Commission sees little change to the medium-term outlook and revises 2026 growth only slightly\u2014say, to 1.4%\u2014with minimal mention of tariffs or trade uncertainty.\n\n(d) A scenario yielding a Yes: Trade tensions worsen (e.g., more US-EU tariffs or broader spillovers), weakening external demand enough that the Commission cuts the 2026 EU growth forecast to 1.3% or below and points to trade-policy risks as a central driver of that downgrade.\n\nProbability: 60%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 5 Reasoning\n(a) We have about half a year to go (roughly six months) until the Autumn 2025 forecast is released, which is when the question will be definitively answered.\n\n(b) Under a status quo scenario with little further escalation in tariffs or new shocks, the European Commission might maintain its current 1.5% estimate for 2026 or revise only slightly (e.g., to 1.4%), thereby falling short of the 0.2-point decrease criterion.\n\n(c) A \u201cNo\u201d outcome would occur if, for instance, the Commission\u2019s Autumn 2025 update lowers the 2026 forecast only to around 1.4%, or even 1.3% but omits explicit mention of trade/tariff uncertainty. Alternatively, they may leave the 2026 forecast unchanged at 1.5%, citing other factors (e.g., domestic demand or fiscal policies) rather than trade tensions.\n\n(d) A \u201cYes\u201d outcome would occur if the Commission lowers the 2026 forecast to 1.3% or below (e.g., 1.2%) and explicitly blames trade policy disruptions or tariffs as a key contributor. Continued US-EU tariff escalation or significant trade uncertainty would almost certainly prompt that downgrade and clear mention of its trade-related causes.\n\nProbability: 70%\n\n",

The Commission urges decisive actions to enhance the EU's competitiveness.\n\n**Sources:**\n*   [HABERTURK.COM](https://www.haberturk.com/ab-2025-yili-ekonomik-buyume-tahminini-dusurdu-3792233-ekonomi)\n*   [birgun.net](https://www.birgun.net/haber/ab-komisyonu-2025-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize-etti-624219)\n*   [ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/05/19/o-momento-da-europa-para-agir-e-agora/)\n*   [Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/economia/news/dazi_ue_riduce_stime_pil_cosa_succede-8845536.html)\n*   [ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/economia/2025/05/19/lue-taglia-la-stima-sul-pil-dellitalia-07-nel-2025-09-nel-2026_d384818e-bb75-476c-ae45-3af09b0e9117.html)\n*   [\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Neftegaz.ru](https://neftegaz.ru/news/finance/889150-ek-snizila-prognoz-rosta-vvp-es-na-2025-g-iz-za-poshlin-i-neopredelennosti/)\n*   [\u65b0\u534e\u7f51 (Xinhuanet Spanish)](http://spanish.xinhuanet.com/20250519/6c76677b89494adea026e0870701be3b/c.html)\n*   [Son Dakika](https://www.sondakika.com/ekonomi/haber-ab-ekonomi-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize--18648430/)\n*   [Il Fatto Quotidiano](https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2025/05/19/commissione-europea-stime-crescita-italia-notizie/7993760/)\n*   [SIR - Servizio Informazione Religiosa](https://www.agensir.it/quotidiano/2025/5/19/commissione-ue-previsioni-economiche-prospettive-peggiorate-i-dazi-pesano-sul-commercio-internazionale/)\n*   [RFI (Chinese)](https://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E5%9B%BD%E9%99%85/20250513-%E6%AC%A7%E7%9B%9F%E8%B4%B8%E6%98%93%E4%B8%93%E5%91%98-%E6%AC%A7%E7%9B%9F%E4%BB%8A%E5%B9%B4%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E%E5%A2%9E%E9%95%BF%E9%A2%84%E6%9C%9F%E4%BB%8D%E6%82%B2%E8%A7%82)\n*   [Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2 (UDN Money)](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5599/8738001)\n*   [El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/invertia/economia/macroeconomia/20250422/fmi-aplica-gran-recorte-economia-baja-decimas-pib-mundial-eeuu-solo-mejora-espana/1003743723998_0.html)\n*   [\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51 (East Money)](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202503273357173521.html)\n*   [\u65b0\u534e\u7f51 (Xinhuanet Spanish, OECD)](http://spanish.xinhuanet.com/20250318/6d14e583b4914a6a8567a3552912cf1a/c.html)\n*   [LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/agencias/2025/03/17/la-ocde-revisa-a-la-baja-el-crecimiento-mundial-en-2025-en-un-contexto-de-tensiones-comerciales-208735)\n*   [European Central Bank (Polish)](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/projections/html/ecb.projections202503_ecbstaff~106050a4fa.pl.html)\n*   [Quotidiano Libero](https://www.liberoquotidiano.it/video/video-news-by-vista/41805230/lagarde-bce-incertezza-politiche-commerciali-pesa-su-export-e-investimenti.html)\n*   [ECO (earlier article)](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/02/17/mais-pessimista-sobre-crescimento-bruxelas-avisa-para-ambiente-internacional-imprevisivel/)\n*   [eunews.it](https://www.eunews.it/2025/02/17/eurozona-crescita-piu-bassa-del-previsto/)\n\n**Forecaster Reasoning Highlights:**\nThe forecasters generally agree that the outcome depends on events in the next six months, particularly regarding trade tensions.\n\n*   **Status Quo:** If nothing significant changes, the Commission might not revise the 2026 forecast down by the required 0.2 percentage points, or might not explicitly cite trade uncertainty.\n*   **\"No\" Scenario:** Trade frictions could ease, or remain marginal, leading to only a slight revision (e.g., to 1.4%) or no explicit mention of trade uncertainty as a primary cause.\n*   **\"Yes\" Scenario:** Worsening trade tensions (e.g., more US-EU tariffs) could lead the Commission to cut the 2026 forecast to 1.3% or below, explicitly citing these trade-related risks.\n\nThe consensus is that there's a moderate chance (60-70%) that both conditions (the 0.2 percentage point downward revision and the explicit citation of trade uncertainty) will be met.Okay, I've completed all the steps you requested!\n\n**Step 1: Generate a number of random topics**\nI generated a list of random headlines.\n\n**Step 2: Pick one**\nI selected the topic: \"EU lowers economic growth expectations due to global trade uncertainty.\"\n\n**Step 3: Decompose this topic into sub-questions**\nI broke down the topic into five specific, forecastable questions and provided research context.\n\n**Step 4: Operationalize this question**\nI took the first sub-question: \"Will the European Commission's Autumn 2025 Economic Forecast revise the EU's 2026 real GDP growth forecast downwards by at least 0.2 percentage points compared to the Spring 2025 forecast (1.4% for Eurozone, 1.5% for EU), explicitly citing \"trade uncertainty,\" \"tariffs,\" or \"protectionism\" as a primary reason?\" and operationalized it into a detailed, binary forecast question.\n\n**Step 5: Forecast the question**\nI successfully forecasted the operationalized question. The final prediction is **60.0% probability** that the European Commission's Autumn 2025 Economic Forecast will revise the EU's 2026 real GDP growth forecast downwards by at least 0.2 percentage points compared to the Spring 2025 forecast, explicitly citing trade uncertainty as a contributing factor.\n\nThe research indicates that the European Commission has already revised growth projections downward for 2025 and 2026 in its Spring 2025 forecast due to global trade tensions, particularly US tariffs. The EU's 2026 growth forecast was revised from 1.8% down to 1.5% in the Spring. For the question to resolve as \"Yes,\" a further downward revision to 1.3% or lower in the Autumn 2025 forecast, with trade uncertainty explicitly cited, would be needed. Forecasters believe there is a 60% chance of this occurring.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?",

Vingegaard argues that the narrow streets of Montmartre will create unnecessary stress for the riders, particularly given the larger peloton of 150 cyclists compared to the 50 riders in the Olympic Games. He emphasizes that the organizers should prioritize a challenging yet exciting final stage without complicating the route. Remco Evenepoel, another prominent cyclist, has echoed similar sentiments, suggesting that the final stage should ideally favor sprinters on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es instead.\n\nAdditionally, the organizers of the Tour de France are expected to reveal more details about the final stage's route soon, which may address the concerns raised by Vingegaard and others. The research highlights the differing opinions among cyclists regarding the route and the potential implications for the race's outcome.\n\nSources:\n- [RMC SPORT](https://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/cyclisme/tour-de-france/tour-de-france-2025-pourquoi-vingegaard-n-est-pas-du-tout-emballe-par-le-passage-du-peloton-a-montmartre_AV-202505190668.html)\n- [Le Parisien](https://www.leparisien.fr/sports/cyclisme/tour-de-france/tour-de-france-2025-je-ne-pense-pas-que-ce-soit-une-bonne-idee-vingegaard-pas-fan-de-letape-de-montmartre-19-05-2025-II2GFU5U4VHQHIR6OLYWAEJ6JE.php)\n- [Ouest France](https://www.ouest-france.fr/tour-de-france/tour-de-france-2025-jonas-vingegaard-pas-emballe-a-lidee-de-passer-par-montmartre-8ea76acc-34bc-11f0-b184-9fce0c190a12)\n\n\n# RESEARCH\n## Report 1 Research\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Vingegaard Expresses Concerns Over Montmartre Stage in 2025 Tour de France**\nJonas Vingegaard, the two-time Tour de France winner, is not enthusiastic about the idea of the peloton passing through Montmartre during the final stage of the 2025 Tour de France. According to Vingegaard, 'it's not a good idea' because the narrow streets of Montmartre will add stress to the riders, who will be fighting for position in a crowded peloton of 150 riders. This is in contrast to the Olympic Games, where there were only 50 riders in the peloton. Vingegaard believes that the Tour de France organizers should not 'complicate things' and instead focus on providing a challenging and exciting final stage. Despite his concerns, Vingegaard is confident in his preparation and believes that he will be 'better than ever' at the start of the Tour de France, and is 'almost sure' that he will be able to compete for the victory.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 04:29 PM\nSource:[RMC SPORT](https://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/cyclisme/tour-de-france/tour-de-france-2025-pourquoi-vingegaard-n-est-pas-du-tout-emballe-par-le-passage-du-peloton-a-montmartre_AV-202505190668.html)\n\n**Vingegaard and Evenepoel Speak Out Against Montmartre Stage in 2025 Tour de France**\nJonas Vingegaard, the two-time Tour de France winner, expressed his disapproval of the final stage of the 2025 Tour de France, which will include a climb up the Butte Montmartre in Paris. 'I'm not a fan of the idea,' Vingegaard said, 'Montmartre was nice during the Olympics, but it was with only 50 riders left in the peloton. On the Tour de France, we'll have 150 riders fighting for position on a very narrow climb, which could add more stress than needed.' This is not the first time a rider has spoken out against the idea, as Remco Evenepoel also expressed his disapproval in April, saying 'I don't think it's a good idea, it's unnecessary stress.

According to Vingegaard, 'it's not a good idea' because the narrow streets of Montmartre will add stress to the riders, who will be fighting for position in a crowded peloton of 150 riders. This is in contrast to the Olympic Games, where there were only 50 riders in the peloton. Vingegaard believes that the Tour de France organizers should not 'complicate things' and instead focus on providing a challenging and exciting final stage. Despite his concerns, Vingegaard is confident in his preparation and believes that he will be 'better than ever' at the start of the Tour de France, and is 'almost sure' that he will be able to compete for the victory.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 04:29 PM\nSource:[RMC SPORT](https://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/cyclisme/tour-de-france/tour-de-france-2025-pourquoi-vingegaard-n-est-pas-du-tout-emballe-par-le-passage-du-peloton-a-montmartre_AV-202505190668.html)\n\n**Vingegaard and Evenepoel Speak Out Against Montmartre Stage in 2025 Tour de France**\nJonas Vingegaard, the two-time Tour de France winner, expressed his disapproval of the final stage of the 2025 Tour de France, which will include a climb up the Butte Montmartre in Paris.

Jonas Vingegaard, who has twice won the Tour, is his main threat, but Poga\u010dar has repeatedly shown he can outclimb and out-time-trial almost anyone when in top form.\n\n(c) Scenario that results in an unexpected outcome: \nGrand Tours often include crashes, illness, or brutally hot stages. A single misfortune or a bad day in the high mountains could tilt the race. If Poga\u010dar or Vingegaard crashes out or suffers a bout of illness, a rising younger rider like Juan Ayuso or Jo\u00e3o Almeida\u2014or even a different dark horse\u2014could go on to claim the maillot jaune.\n\nFinal Probabilities \u2192 ['Tadej Poga\u010dar', 'Jonas Vingegaard', 'Remco Evenepoel', 'Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d', 'Jo\u00e3o Almeida', 'Juan Ayuso', 'Other']:\n\nTadej Poga\u010dar: 30%  \nJonas Vingegaard: 25%  \nRemco Evenepoel: 15%  \nPrimo\u017e Rogli\u010d: 10%  \nJo\u00e3o Almeida: 5%  \nJuan Ayuso: 5%  \nOther: 10%  \n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 2 Reasoning\n(a) Time Left Until Outcome:  \nThere are roughly two months until the outcome is officially known. The 2025 Tour de France begins on July 5 and finishes on July 27, so we will have definitive results in about 68 days.\n\n(b) Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changed:  \nDespite the uncertainty that always accompanies Grand Tours, Tadej Poga\u010dar is currently the top favorite and has demonstrated repeated winning form (2020, 2021, and 2024). If everything proceeds normally\u2014meaning no major crashes, illnesses, or extreme surprises\u2014Poga\u010dar likely remains the strongest pick to win the 2025 Tour.\n\n(c) Scenario Resulting in an Unexpected Outcome:  \nA classic scenario involves an accident in the first week, where multiple GC contenders lose significant time due to crashes or mechanicals. A different contender (maybe someone not in the top handful of favorites\u2014such as a talented rider on a breakout performance or a rider not even listed in the main favorites) seizes the chance, gains time, and carries that momentum to an overall victory. In that rare case, we would see a genuine upset and the answer resolve as \u201cOther.\u201d\n\nFinal Probabilities (in %):  \nTadej Poga\u010dar: 35%  \nJonas Vingegaard: 30%  \nRemco Evenepoel: 15%  \nPrimo\u017e Rogli\u010d: 10%  \nJo\u00e3o Almeida: 3%  \nJuan Ayuso: 3%  \nOther: 4%  \n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 3 Reasoning\n(a) Time left until the outcome is known:  \nThe 2025 Tour de France will end on July 27, 2025. As of May 20, 2025, there are about 68 days until the official winner is declared.\n\n(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed:  \nTadej Poga\u010dar remains the strongest favorite. He has a phenomenal track record (three Tour wins so far: 2020, 2021, 2024) and is widely considered the most talented cyclist of his generation. Traditionally, the rider who is in top form and has excelled in multi\u2010week stage races tends to prevail, and Poga\u010dar\u2019s history attests to his consistency. Jonas Vingegaard poses a persistent threat, but if everything simply continues on its current trajectory, Poga\u010dar\u2019s talent and proven experience give him the edge.\n\n(c) An unexpected scenario that changes the outcome:  \nThe Tour can be unpredictable. In a scenario where Poga\u010dar or Vingegaard endures a crash, illness, or major incident in the decisive mountain stages, the door could open for another high-profile contender (e.g., Remco Evenepoel or Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d) or a less-heralded rider on top form (e.g., Jo\u00e3o Almeida, Juan Ayuso, or someone not yet in the conversation). Weather and route complexities\u2014like the contested Montmartre inclusion\u2014can further shake up even the most prepared favorite.\n\nFinal probabilities for the 2025 Tour de France winner:  \nTadej Poga\u010dar: 35%  \nJonas Vingegaard: 30%  \nRemco Evenepoel: 15%  \nPrimo\u017e Rogli\u010d: 8%  \nJo\u00e3o Almeida: 5%  \nJuan Ayuso: 3%  \nOther: 4%  \n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 4 Reasoning\n(a) Time left until the outcome is known:  \nThe 2025 Tour de France will finish on July 27, 2025. As of May 20, 2025, there are a little over two months left before we know the official winner.\n\n(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed:  \nTadej Poga\u010dar stands out as the top favorite, having already won multiple Tours (2020, 2021, 2024) and continued to show his brilliance. Jonas Vingegaard, a two-time Tour winner himself, looks like the principal alternate contender. Both riders\u2019 consistency and ongoing success make them the leading candidates if form and luck stay the same.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in an unexpected outcome:  \nPoga\u010dar or Vingegaard could face a crash or a sudden illness in the opening week, weakening or removing one of them from contention. Meanwhile, a young rising talent\u2014perhaps Jo\u00e3o Almeida or Juan Ayuso\u2014could seize the opportunity, avoid trouble, and claim the maillot jaune. Alternatively, Remco Evenepoel\u2019s explosive climbing and time trial prowess might all come together for a first Tour triumph, cutting through the chaos of mountains and mishaps.\n\nFinal Probabilities:  \nTadej Poga\u010dar: 35%  \nJonas Vingegaard: 25%  \nRemco Evenepoel: 15%  \nPrimo\u017e Rogli\u010d: 8%  \nJo\u00e3o Almeida: 5%  \nJuan Ayuso: 5%  \nOther: 7%  \n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 5 Reasoning\n(a) Time remaining until the outcome is known:  \nToday is May 20, 2025, and the Tour de France 2025 will conclude on July 27, 2025, so there are about 68 days until we know who the winner is.\n\n(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes:  \nTadej Poga\u010dar is widely viewed as the top favorite, coming off multiple previous Tour victories (2020, 2021, and 2024). Jonas Vingegaard, a two-time winner, is considered the next strongest contender. Barring accidents, illness, or dramatic surprises, one of these two would most likely take the title.\n\n(c) An unexpected scenario:  \nA crash or injury could sideline both Tadej Poga\u010dar and Jonas Vingegaard. Remco Evenepoel could then emerge as the strongest rider over the high mountains and time trials, seizing the yellow jersey in a late-stage upset. Alternatively, a younger rider like Juan Ayuso or Jo\u00e3o Almeida could make a breakout performance and hold on to win despite intense competition.\n\nFinal Probabilities:  \nTadej Poga\u010dar: 33%  \nJonas Vingegaard: 28%  \nRemco Evenepoel: 12%  \nPrimo\u017e Rogli\u010d: 6%  \nJo\u00e3o Almeida: 5%  \nJuan Ayuso: 4%  \nOther: 12%  \n\n",

Riders\u2019 Top Concerns  \n\u2003\u2013 Jonas Vingegaard (2022 & 2023 winner) publicly criticized the inclusion of a Montmartre climb on Stage 21, warning that the narrow streets will create stress and increase crash risk in a full peloton of 150 (vs. 50 at the Olympics). Vingegaard and Remco Evenepoel both argued the final stage should favor sprinters on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es instead. [RMC SPORT], [Le Parisien], [Ouest France]  \n2. Course Implications  \n\u2003\u2013 The final\u2010stage route remains officially unpublished (to be revealed May 21), but Montmartre\u2019s steep, narrow ascent could reshape GC battles or provoke crashes late on the last day.  \n3.

Upset Scenarios  \n\u2003\u2013 Crashes or illness derailing one or both favorites.  \n\u2003\u2013 Severe weather or mechanicals in key mountain stages.  \n\u2003\u2013 A dark\u2010horse rider avoids trouble and capitalizes on GC contenders\u2019 misfortune.\n\n\u2014  \n**Forecaster Reasoning (Summary)**  \n\u2022 Nearly all forecasters (1\u20135) identify Poga\u010dar as the top pick (30\u201335%) and Vingegaard as a strong second (25\u201330%).  \n\u2022 Remco Evenepoel sits in the mid\u2010teens (12\u201315%).  \n\u2022 Rogli\u010d is given 6\u201310%, with Almeida (3\u20135%) and Ayuso (3\u20135%) trailing.  \n\u2022 \u201cOther\u201d scenarios (dark\u2010horse upset) range from 4\u201312%, reflecting Grand Tour volatility.\n\n\u2014  \n**Sources**  \n1.
