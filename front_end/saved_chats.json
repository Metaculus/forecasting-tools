While the top riders waited for the right moment to move, Prodhomme, of the Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale team, was able to resist the return of the best riders and cross the finish line alone, thus securing his first career win in a Grand Tour. The 19th stage was one of the most challenging of the edition, with 174 kilometers in the Alps and a difficult route that included five climbs, including three of the first category. Prodhomme was part of a group of around 30 riders who broke away early in the stage, including well-known names like Steinhauser, Cattaneo, Lemmen, Bardet, Van Aert, and Tiberi. He remained with the best riders as the group of leaders narrowed down on the steepest climbs. On the penultimate climb of the day, the Col de Joux, Prodhomme made the decisive move, dropping his last companions and launching himself towards the finish line. Only in the final kilometers of the Antagnod climb did the favorites make their move. Richard Carapaz tried an attack, but was quickly answered by the maglia rosa Isaac Del Toro. The two riders were able to gain a few seconds on the other riders in the general classification, but the overall standings remained unchanged. Simon Yates, one of the main contenders, lost a few seconds but remains in the running for the podium. Prodhomme was able to manage his lead well, maintaining a sufficient advantage until the finish and thus crowning a perfect day with a well-deserved victory. The general classification remains stable, but everything is still up for grabs. On Saturday, the decisive stage will take place, with the ascent to the legendary Colle delle Finestre, designated as the Cima Coppi of this year, which could revolutionize the balance of power and decide the winner of the final stage. On Sunday, the Giro d'Italia will conclude with the traditional final stage in Rome, where the sprinters will have their last chance and the public will be able to celebrate the winner of the 2025 edition.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 05:22 PM\nSource:[Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/sport/ciclismo/giro_d_italia_2025_champoluc_vince_prodhomme_domani_tappa_decisiva_la_situazione-8868900.html)\n\n**Pierre Latour Wins Stage 2 of Boucles de la Mayenne 2025**\nPierre Latour (TotalEnergies) won the second stage of the Boucles de la Mayenne 2025, a 166 km ride from Saint-Berthevin to Juvign\u00e9, on Friday, May 30. Thibaud Gruel (Groupama FDJ) retained the leader's jersey ahead of the queen stage. The stage was expected to be a sprint finish, but Latour outsmarted the sprinters, including Biniam Girmay (Intermarch\u00e9 Wanty) and Paul Penho\u00ebt (Groupama FDJ), by attacking Florian S\u00e9n\u00e9chal (Ark\u00e9a B & B H\u00f4tels) in a final climb 1.5 km from the finish line. Latour held off the chase by the Intermarch\u00e9 Wanty team and took the solo win. Girmay and Penho\u00ebt completed the podium.

While the top riders waited for the right moment to move, Prodhomme, of the Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale team, was able to resist the return of the best riders and cross the finish line alone, thus securing his first career win in a Grand Tour. The 19th stage was one of the most challenging of the edition, with 174 kilometers in the Alps and a difficult route that included five climbs, including three of the first category. Prodhomme was part of a group of around 30 riders who broke away early in the stage, including well-known names like Steinhauser, Cattaneo, Lemmen, Bardet, Van Aert, and Tiberi. He remained with the best riders as the group of leaders narrowed down on the steepest climbs. On the penultimate climb of the day, the Col de Joux, Prodhomme made the decisive move, dropping his last companions and launching himself towards the finish line. Only in the final kilometers of the Antagnod climb did the favorites make their move. Richard Carapaz tried an attack, but was quickly answered by the maglia rosa Isaac Del Toro. The two riders were able to gain a few seconds on the other riders in the general classification, but the overall standings remained unchanged. Simon Yates, one of the main contenders, lost a few seconds but remains in the running for the podium. Prodhomme was able to manage his lead well, maintaining a sufficient advantage until the finish and thus crowning a perfect day with a well-deserved victory. The general classification remains stable, but everything is still up for grabs. On Saturday, the decisive stage will take place, with the ascent to the legendary Colle delle Finestre, designated as the Cima Coppi of this year, which could revolutionize the balance of power and decide the winner of the final stage. On Sunday, the Giro d'Italia will conclude with the traditional final stage in Rome, where the sprinters will have their last chance and the public will be able to celebrate the winner of the 2025 edition.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 30, 2025 05:22 PM\nSource:[Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/sport/ciclismo/giro_d_italia_2025_champoluc_vince_prodhomme_domani_tappa_decisiva_la_situazione-8868900.html)\n\n**Giro 2025: Nicolas Prodhomme Wins Solo Stage, Del Toro Maintains Lead**\nNicolas Prodhomme gave France its first win in the 108th edition of the Giro by winning the queen stage in Champoluc on Friday.

                        "text": "### Questions for the 3-Month Horizon (by August 20, 2025)\n\n1.  **New US Regulatory Action Against Polymarket by August 20, 2025?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Review official announcements from US federal (e.g., CFTC, SEC, DOJ) and New York state regulatory agencies (e.g., NYDFS, NY Attorney General) and major financial news outlets for any new formal regulatory actions (e.g., fines, sanctions, lawsuits initiated, cease and desist orders) publicly announced against Polymarket or its key executives.\n    *   **Background Information:** Polymarket, a leading prediction market, has faced past regulatory scrutiny in the US, notably settling with the CFTC in 2022 and agreeing to block US users. \"New\" action excludes ongoing compliance with the 2022 settlement. This question assesses the ongoing regulatory risk, a key threat/weakness.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** Polymarket was ordered to pay a $1.4 million civil monetary penalty by the CFTC in January 2022 and to cease and desist from offering off-exchange event-based binary options contracts in the US. (Source: CFTC Press Release No. 8478-22, January 3, 2022, available at [https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8478-22](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8478-22)).\n\n2.  **Kalshi to Launch Individual NFL Regular Season Game Outcome Contracts by August 20, 2025?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Check Kalshi's official website (markets page, blog, press releases) and major financial/betting news outlets for the listing of event contracts specifically on the outcomes (win/loss) of individual NFL regular season games for the 2025-2026 season.\n    *   **Background Information:** Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated prediction market, has been expanding its sports-related offerings. They recently launched MLB game outcome contracts. Expansion into the NFL, a significantly larger market, would be a major product launch.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** Kalshi announced the launch of markets for individual MLB game outcomes in April 2025. (Source: e.g., Covers.com article \"Kalshi Launches MLB Game Markets Despite Scrutiny Over Sports Contracts,\" April 17, 2025.)\n\n3.  **Unexpected Shutdown or Bankruptcy of a Top 3 Prediction Market by August 20, 2025?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Monitor official announcements (website, social media, press releases) from Polymarket, Kalshi, and PredictIt, and check major financial and cryptocurrency news outlets for any declarations of permanent shutdown of operations, insolvency, or bankruptcy filings by any of these three platforms.\n    *   **Background Information:** \"Top 3\" refers to Polymarket, Kalshi, and PredictIt, which are frequently cited as leading platforms by user engagement or regulatory status. A sudden failure of one of these would be a high-impact \"black swan\" event for the sector.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** While major cryptocurrency exchanges (like FTX in November 2022) have failed, directly comparable prediction markets of this scale have not typically shut down suddenly in very recent short windows.\n\n4.  **New G7 Central Bank (excluding BoE) or National Financial Regulator Announces Formal Integration of Prediction Market Data for Economic Forecasting by August 20, 2025?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Review official websites and press release sections of G7 central banks (Bank of Canada, European Central Bank, Bank of France, Deutsche Bundesbank, Bank of Italy, Bank of Japan, US Federal Reserve) and their respective national financial regulators for any public announcements of new formal initiatives, pilot programs, or frameworks explicitly stating the integration of data from prediction markets or an internal judgemental forecasting tournament for their official economic forecasting or policy guidance.\n    *   **Background Information:** The Bank of England recently reviewed its forecasting methods. This question explores if other major economic bodies will adopt similar innovative approaches. \"Formal initiative\" means a documented program or policy shift, not just a research paper.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** Searches for such formal integrations by G7 central banks (excluding BoE) in the recent past (e.g., past 1-2 years) do not yield announcements of such formal integrations into official processes.\n\n5.  **Conditional on High MLB Volume, Will Kalshi Announce Expansion to NFL/NBA Regular Season Game Contracts by August 20, 2025?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:**\n        1.  Monitor Kalshi's publicly available information to determine if the average weekly trading volume for its MLB individual regular-season game outcome contracts exceed $500,000 for any four consecutive weeks between May 20, 2025, and July 20, 2025. If such specific volume data is not made publicly available by July 20, 2025, the condition will be deemed not met.\n        2.  If the condition in step 1 is met, then monitor Kalshi's official announcements and major financial/betting news outlets until August 20, 2025, for any public announcement of the intent to list, or the actual listing of, event contracts on individual regular-season game outcomes for either the NFL or NBA.\n    *   **Background Information:** This conditional question aims to identify an underlying driver of strategic expansion. It posits that if a new product category (MLB game contracts) demonstrates significant user adoption, Kalshi might be incentivized to expand into other major sports leagues.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** Specific conditional questions like this rarely have direct past resolutions. However, Kalshi's general expansion strategy has involved launching new market categories over time (e.g., MLB game markets in April 2025).\n\n### Questions for the 1-Year Horizon (by May 20, 2026)\n\n1.  **Will Polymarket announce any new partnerships with traditional financial institutions (e.g., banks, investment firms) or major regulated media outlets (e.g., established newspapers with national circulation, major television news networks) via its official blog or primary X (Twitter) feed by May 20, 2026?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Review Polymarket's official blog and primary official X (Twitter) feed for any announcements of new partnerships fitting the criteria between May 21, 2025, and May 20, 2026.\n    *   **Background Information:** Partnerships with established financial institutions or major regulated media could signify mainstream adoption or increased regulatory comfort for Polymarket.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** Between May 20, 2024, and May 20, 2025, Polymarket announced a partnership with Perplexity (an AI search engine, not a traditional financial institution or regulated media outlet) in August 2024 (Source: TechCrunch, [https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/prediction-market-polymarket-partners-with-perplexity-to-show-news-summaries/](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/prediction-market-polymarket-partners-with-perplexity-to-show-news-summaries/)).\n\n2.  **By May 20, 2026, will Kalshi introduce and feature on its main platform at least two new *distinct event contract categories* that are not primarily sub-categories of its existing 12 categories listed as of May 20, 2025?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** On May 20, 2026, review the categories of event contracts listed on Kalshi's official website. Compare this to the 12 categories listed as of May 20, 2025 (Politics, Sports, Culture, Crypto, Climate, Economics, Companies, Financials, Tech & Science, Health, World, Transportation).\n    *   **Background Information:** The introduction of new event categories reflects Kalshi's growth strategy and expansion into new forecasting areas.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** As of May 20, 2025, Kalshi listed 12 distinct categories. The number of top-level categories appeared stable from May 2024 to May 2025.\n\n3.  **Between May 21, 2025, and May 20, 2026, will either The Block Crypto or Cointelegraph publish an article confirming a security breach leading to a direct loss of user funds, or a regulatory shutdown ordering cessation of services, specifically for a prediction market platform that had a self-reported or independently estimated total annual trading volume exceeding $5 million USD in the 12 months prior to the event?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** On May 21, 2026, search the websites of The Block Crypto and Cointelegraph for articles published between May 21, 2025, and May 20, 2026, using relevant keywords.\n    *   **Background Information:** This question gauges the operational and regulatory stability of larger prediction market platforms.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** Based on a search for the period May 20, 2024, to May 20, 2025, no articles were found detailing such an event for a prediction market platform meeting the volume criteria.\n\n4.  **By May 20, 2026, will the official websites of Good Judgment Inc. (goodjudgment.com) or Hypermind (hypermind.com) collectively feature at least one new publicly accessible case study or whitepaper that explicitly names a company from the S&P 100 list (as of January 1, 2025) as a client or details a project undertaken with them?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** On May 20, 2026, review the \"Case Studies,\" \"Resources,\" \"Clients,\" or similar sections on goodjudgment.com and hypermind.com. Compare the list of case studies/whitepapers featuring named S&P 100 companies to those available on May 20, 2025.\n    *   **Background Information:** Adoption by S&P 100 companies, showcased publicly, would indicate growing corporate trust in these judgemental forecasting services.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** As of May 20, 2025, neither Good Judgment Inc. nor Hypermind explicitly listed case studies or whitepapers featuring named S&P 100 companies on their public websites. (Source: Good Judgment Case Studies page [https://goodjudgment.com/resources/case-studies/](https://goodjudgment.com/resources/case-studies/)).\n\n5.  **If a prediction market platform's native utility token (not previously listed on Kraken) gets newly listed for trading on Kraken by November 20, 2025, will its average daily trading volume across all exchanges in the 30 days *following* the Kraken listing be at least 50% greater than its average daily trading volume in the 30 days *prior* to the Kraken listing announcement?**\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Monitor announcements from Kraken and prediction market platforms for new listings. If such a listing occurs, use a reputable crypto data aggregator (e.g., CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko) to find the token's historical daily trading volume. Calculate the average daily volume for the 30 days immediately preceding the listing announcement and the 30 days starting from the listing date. Compare the two averages.\n    *   **Background Information:** Listing on a major exchange like Kraken can significantly increase a token's visibility and trading volume. This question explores the \"exchange listing effect\" for prediction market tokens.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** For a comparable example, Flux (FLUX) was listed on Binance on December 10, 2021. One would access historical data from CoinMarketCap (e.g., [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zel/flux/historical-data/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zel/flux/historical-data/)) or CoinGecko for the relevant periods to calculate the percentage change in average daily volume.\n\nI hope these questions are helpful for your forecasting efforts!

[1](https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/general/3029235/trump-tariffs-force-eu-to-cut-2025-eurozone-growth-forecast) [6](https://www.mitrade.com/insights/news/live-news/article-3-829219-20250519)\n\nThe EU's economic trajectory now hinges on resolving trade disputes while maintaining domestic demand through wage growth and employment stability. However, the Commission warns that prolonged uncertainty could extend the growth slowdown into 2026. [3](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/economy/eu-cuts-economic-growth-forecasts-amid-tariff-uncertainty/3572910) [4](https://www.shine.cn/news/world/2505198299/) [6](https://www.mitrade.com/insights/news/live-news/article-3-829219-20250519)\n\nHere are the decomposed sub-questions:\n\n1.  **Question:** Will the European Commission's Autumn 2025 Economic Forecast revise the EU's 2026 real GDP growth forecast downwards by at least 0.2 percentage points compared to the Spring 2025 forecast (1.4% for Eurozone, 1.5% for EU), explicitly citing \"trade uncertainty,\" \"tariffs,\" or \"protectionism\" as a primary reason?\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Review the European Commission's Autumn 2025 Economic Forecast (typically released in November). Compare the 2026 real GDP growth forecast for the EU with the 1.4% (Eurozone) / 1.5% (EU) figure from the Spring 2025 Economic Forecast. Check the accompanying text for explicit mentions of \"trade uncertainty,\" \"tariffs,\" or \"protectionism\" as primary reasons for any downward revision of at least 0.2 percentage points.\n    *   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2025-12-31\n    *   **Background Information:** The European Commission's Spring 2025 Economic Forecast (published May 19, 2025) already lowered growth expectations for 2025 due to trade uncertainties, particularly US tariff policies. This question assesses if these concerns will further impact the 2026 outlook. A 0.2 percentage point revision is a significant change in such forecasts.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** In the Spring 2025 Economic Forecast, the Commission revised the 2025 EU GDP growth forecast down to 1.1% from 1.5% projected in Autumn 2024 (a 0.4ppt revision for the EU), explicitly citing \"the impact of increased tariffs and the heightened uncertainty caused by the recent abrupt changes in US trade policy.\" (Source: European Commission, Spring 2025 Economic Forecast, [https://economy-finance.ec.europa.eu/economic-forecast-and-surveys/economic-forecasts/spring-2025-economic-forecast-moderate-growth-amid-global-economic-uncertainty_en](https://economy-finance.ec.europa.eu/economic-forecast-and-surveys/economic-forecasts/spring-2025-economic-forecast-moderate-growth-amid-global-economic-uncertainty_en))\n\n2.  **Question:** According to Eurostat's first estimate for the full year 2025, will the EU's trade in goods surplus with the United States be lower than the \u20ac157 billion recorded for 2023?\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Obtain Eurostat's first estimate for the EU's international trade in goods with the US for the full year 2025 (exports minus imports). This data is typically released by Eurostat in February/March of the following year. Compare this figure to the \u20ac157 billion surplus recorded for 2023.\n    *   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2026-03-31\n    *   **Background Information:** The EU recorded a trade in goods surplus with the US of \u20ac157 billion in 2023. Increased US protectionism or a slowdown in US demand could reduce this surplus. This tracks a key direct impact of trade relations.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** The EU's trade in goods surplus with the US was \u20ac205.6 billion in 2022 and fell to \u20ac157 billion in 2023. (Source: Eurostat [https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=USA-EU_-_international_trade_in_goods_statistics](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=USA-EU_-_international_trade_in_goods_statistics) for 2022 data, and European Commission [https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/eu-trade-relationships-country-and-region/countries-and-regions/united-states_en](https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/eu-trade-relationships-country-and-region/countries-and-regions/united-states_en) for 2023 data).\n\n3.  **Question:** Between June 1, 2025, and December 31, 2025, will the EU initiate more than one new formal trade dispute consultation against the United States at the World Trade Organization (WTO) where US tariffs or trade-related measures are cited as the primary concern?\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Monitor the WTO's official dispute settlement database ([https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/dispu_status_e.htm](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/dispu_status_e.htm)) for new requests for consultation initiated by the EU against the US. Count the number of such unique dispute cases filed within the specified period where tariffs/trade measures are the focus.\n    *   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2026-01-15\n    *   **Background Information:** Increased trade friction often leads to formal disputes. The EU has countermeasures prepared against recent US tariffs, with a suspension until mid-July 2025. The number of new WTO cases is an indicator of escalating trade tensions and the EU's response.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** In response to US steel and aluminum tariffs imposed in 2018, the EU filed one major WTO challenge (DS548) on June 1, 2018. (Source: WTO Dispute Settlement database, DS548: United States \u2014 Certain Measures on Steel and Aluminum Products).\n\n4.  **Question:** Will the value of EU exports of \"Motor cars and other motor vehicles principally designed for the transport of persons\" (HS Code 8703) to the USA for the period July-December 2025 be at least 5% lower than the value reported for July-December 2024, according to Eurostat data?\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Access Eurostat's international trade database (Comext) after the data for December 2025 becomes available (likely February/March 2026). Extract the value of EU exports to the USA for HS code 8703 for July-December 2025 and July-December 2024. Calculate the percentage change.\n    *   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2026-03-31\n    *   **Background Information:** The automotive sector is a significant component of EU-US trade and has been subject to tariff threats and actual tariff impositions (e.g. US has a general 25% tariff on cars as of May 2025). A decline in export value in this key sector would be a tangible impact of trade uncertainty and/or tariffs.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** While a direct comparison for this specific period and product code post-2025 tariffs isn't available yet, historical data from Eurostat can show fluctuations. For instance, during previous trade tensions (e.g., 2018-2019), specific sectors experienced export declines due to tariffs or the threat thereof. For example, S&P Global noted in March 2025 that if the UK (a former EU member but indicative) cannot avoid newly announced 25% tariffs on car exports to the US, it could result in a 0.2% hit to its GDP ([https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/03/29/tariffs-and-defence-spending-sp-global-slashes-eurozone-and-uk-growth-forecast](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/03/29/tariffs-and-defence-spending-sp-global-slashes-eurozone-and-uk-growth-forecast)). Eurostat is the definitive source for past export values.\n\n5.  **Question:** Will Eurostat's first flash estimate for Eurozone quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth for Q3 2025 be 0.1% or lower?\n    *   **Resolution Process:** Check Eurostat's news release for the Q3 2025 flash estimate of quarterly GDP growth for the Eurozone (typically released end of October/early November of the same quarter or shortly after).\n    *   **Expected Resolution Date:** 2025-11-15\n    *   **Background Information:** The European Commission's Spring 2025 forecast projects modest Eurozone GDP growth of 0.9% for 2025. Continued or increased trade uncertainty through mid-2025 could lead to very low or stagnant growth in Q3. The Q1 2025 growth was 0.4%, better than expected, but uncertainty persists.\n    *   **Past Resolution:** Eurostat's first flash estimate for Eurozone Q4 2024 GDP growth was 0.0% (stagnation), released on January 30, 2025 (later revised). (Source: Example based on pattern, for Q4 2024, the flash estimate was released on 30 Jan 2025, details here: [https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/19738797/2-30012025-AP-EN.pdf/](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/19738797/2-30012025-AP-EN.pdf)). The actual Q1 2025 flash estimate was 0.4% QoQ.\n\n**Step 4: Operationalize this question**\n\nI'll pick the first sub-question to operationalize: \"Will the European Commission's Autumn 2025 Economic Forecast revise the EU's 2026 real GDP growth forecast downwards by at least 0.2 percentage points compared to the Spring 2025 forecast (1.4% for Eurozone, 1.5% for EU), explicitly citing \"trade uncertainty,\" \"tariffs,\" or \"protectionism\" as a primary reason?\"\n",

For the Eurozone, the growth is expected to be 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, a decrease from earlier forecasts of 1.3% and 1.6%. The report highlights that the downward revisions are significantly influenced by a weakening global trade outlook and the high levels of uncertainty related to trade policy, particularly due to new tariffs imposed by the US.\n\nEuropean Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis emphasized that the EU economy, while starting the year on a stronger footing than expected, is facing challenges from global uncertainties that are weighing on growth.

The report forecasts that the EU economy will grow by 1.1% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, while the Eurozone economy is expected to grow by 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. This is a downward revision of the Commission's previous 'autumn' report, which forecasted growth of 1.5% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026 for the EU, and 1.3% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026 for the Eurozone. The report states, 'The current forecast has been significantly revised downwards, mainly due to the weakening global trade outlook and high uncertainty related to trade policy.'\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 12:43 PM\nSource:[HABERTURK.COM](https://www.haberturk.com/ab-2025-yili-ekonomik-buyume-tahminini-dusurdu-3792233-ekonomi)\n\n**European Commission Revises 2025 and 2026 Growth Forecasts Downward**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 downward due to global trade tensions and increasing uncertainties. The growth forecast for the Eurozone has been revised from 1.3% to 0.9% for this year, while inflation is expected to continue its downward trend. The European Commission's '2025 Spring European Economic Forecasts' report states that the EU's economy is stronger than expected at the beginning of the year, but global trade tensions and uncertainties are slowing down growth. The report predicts that the EU's economy will grow by 1.1% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. For the Eurozone, the growth rate is expected to be 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. This is a significant decrease from the previous forecast of 1.3% and 1.6%. The revision is attributed to the slowdown in global trade flows and high levels of ongoing trade policy uncertainty. According to the report, Austria's economy is expected to shrink by 0.3% in 2025, while Germany's economy is expected to remain stagnant. France is expected to grow by 0.6%, Italy by 0.7%, and Spain by 2.6% in 2025, while in 2026, Germany is expected to grow by 1.1%, France by 1.3%, Italy by 0.9%, and Spain by 2%. Inflation is expected to be 2.3% in 2025 for the EU and 2.1% for the Eurozone, while in 2026, these rates are expected to decrease to 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively. The report also notes that the US's new tariffs have had a significant impact on global markets, and that the uncertainty surrounding trade policies has increased the pressure on the global economy, affecting the EU directly. The report concludes that the EU's exports will be slowed down by the global demand weakness, and that the trade tensions will continue to have a negative impact on the EU's economy. The report also warns that the commercial fragmentation can have negative effects on growth and that there is a risk of re-emerging inflationary pressures. The report also mentions Turkey's economy, stating that the country's economy is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2025 and 3.5% in 2026, due to the effects of tight monetary and fiscal policies, as well as the decline in energy prices. The report also predicts that Turkey's budget deficit will decrease and its public debt will remain at a reasonable level. European Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis stated in a press conference in Brussels that the European economy is resilient despite the increasing global uncertainties. He also stated that inflation has declined faster than expected and that growth will continue at a moderate pace. He warned that the risks are still downward and that the EU needs to take decisive steps to increase its competitiveness. 'The outlook is still subject to risks, and therefore, we need to take bold steps to increase our competitiveness within the EU.' he said. \nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 12:36 PM\nSource:[birgun.net](https://www.birgun.net/haber/ab-komisyonu-2025-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize-etti-624219)\n\n**EU Economy Losing Steam, Commissioner Warns**\nValdis Dombrovskis, European Commissioner for Economy, stated that the European economy is losing steam and that only swift action can prevent the EU from lagging behind global growth. The European Commission has revised down its growth forecasts for the European economy, in a scenario marked by global uncertainty and trade tensions, particularly with the US. 'Global uncertainty and tensions are weighing on the growth of the European Union', said Dombrovskis, highlighting that, despite the challenges, 'the European economy remains resilient'. The Commission now expects the EU's GDP to grow by only 1.1% in 2025, a downward revision of 0.7 percentage points from the previously forecast 1.5%, and projects an acceleration to 1.5% in 2026. In the Eurozone, growth will be 0.9% this year, rising to 1.4% next year. 'This downward revision of 0.7 percentage points in accumulated terms for 2025-26 is mainly due to the impact of the tariff increase and the uncertainty caused by the abrupt changes in US commercial policy', explained Dombrovskis. The Commissioner warned that 'tensions in trade between the US and the EU, and between the US and China, can depress GDP growth and rekindle inflationary pressures'. On the other hand, 'a relaxation of trade tensions or a faster expansion of EU trade can help sustain growth'. Dombrovskis emphasized that 'the moment for the EU to act is now.' The Commissioner pointed out that 'the deterioration of global trade as a central element of the cut in EU and global GDP growth forecasts.' 'The global growth outside the EU is now projected at 3.2% for 2025 and 2026, a downward revision of 0.4 percentage points from the autumn', revealed Dombrovskis. Despite the slowdown, the European labor market remains robust. 'More jobs are being created and real wages are rising. This means more Europeans working and more money in their pockets', said the Commissioner. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a new historical low of 5.7% in 2026, with the creation of an additional two million jobs by then. 'Tight labor markets and productivity recovery are supporting wage growth', he said, adding that 'real wages are expected to fully recover the lost purchasing power in most member states'. Inflation is decelerating more rapidly than expected in the European space, Dombrovskis noted. 'Inflation is falling faster than expected, driven by the decline in energy prices', he indicated, detailing that the rate in the euro area is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026. In the EU, inflation is expected to follow a similar trajectory, falling to 1.9% in 2026. 'Several factors are exerting downward pressure on inflation, including the appreciation of the euro and increased price competition in non-energy goods', he explained. On the investment side, the recovery will be 'more timid than expected', with gross fixed capital formation growing 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, after a contraction of 1.9% in 2024. 'High uncertainty and tight financial conditions continue to hold back investment', warned Dombrovskis, arguing that 'more investment means a more prosperous and competitive European economy'. In the chapter on public finances, the EU's budget deficit is expected to increase slightly to 3.3% of GDP in 2025, remaining at that level in 2026, while the debt ratio rises modestly due to the increase in financing costs and the slowdown in nominal growth. However, Dombrovskis clarified that 'the impact of the application of the national escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact, which can allow for greater expenditure in defense, is not yet reflected in the forecasts', he clarified.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 11:29 AM\nSource:[ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/05/19/o-momento-da-europa-para-agir-e-agora/)\n\n**EU Economic Growth Forecast Revised Downwards to 0.9% in 2025**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth forecast for the Eurozone to 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, down from 1.3% and 1.6% respectively in the previous forecast. The Commission attributes this to the weakening of global trade prospects and increased uncertainty over trade policies. 'The risks for the prospects are oriented downwards', says the European Commission. The Commission also notes that an additional fragmentation of global trade could mitigate economic growth and rekindle inflationary pressures. On the positive side, a further easing of tensions between the EU and the US or a faster expansion of EU trade with other countries could support EU growth. The EU economy has started 2025 on a slightly more solid basis than expected, according to the Commission, and will continue to grow at a moderate pace this year, with an acceleration expected in 2026, despite the increase in global economic uncertainty and trade tensions. Inflation is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026 in the euro area. The EU's economic growth is expected to be similar, with a decline in inflation to just under 2% in 2026. The EU economy has recorded a growth of 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, above expectations, thanks to internal demand. This momentum has continued into the first quarter of 2025 (+0.3%). However, current forecasts revise downwards the growth prospects due to the worsening of global trade and political uncertainty. The global growth outside the EU is expected to be 3.2% in 2025-2026, down from 3.6% estimated in autumn. EU exports are expected to grow only 0.7% this year, driven by services. Investments, in a slight recovery after -1.8% in 2024, are expected to increase by 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, supported also by the Recovery Fund and the Cohesion Fund. Private consumption is expected to grow by 1.5% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. The labor market remains solid: 1.7 million jobs created in 2024, with an additional 2 million expected. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a historic low of 5.7% in 2026. Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said, 'The uncertainty on the global economic policy has reached levels never seen since the Covid-19 pandemic.' He added, 'The logic behind the US announcements on tariffs is unpredictable and apparently arbitrary, and has led to unprecedented levels of uncertainty on the global economic policy.' 'Since January, the new US administration has increased tariffs on imports from an increasing number of partner countries and on specific goods. The average tariff rate applied by the US on imports is today higher than at any other time since the 1930s.' 'The US announcements in April have also caused very high levels of market volatility. This market volatility remains high and the sentiment is fragile, as a great uncertainty on US trade and economic policy still looms,' he concluded.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 10:47 AM\nSource:[Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/economia/news/dazi_ue_riduce_stime_pil_cosa_succede-8845536.html)\n\n**European Commission Revises Down Economic Growth Forecasts for Eurozone**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth forecasts for the Eurozone downwards. The commission has lowered its forecast for this year's economic growth to 0.9% from 1.3%, and for next year to 1.4% from 1.6%. The commission's 'Spring 2025 Economic Forecast' report states that the European economy is expected to grow at a rate of 1.1% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, while the Eurozone economy is expected to grow at a rate of 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. The commission's previous 'autumn' report had forecasted a growth rate of 1.5% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026 for the European economy, and 1.3% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026 for the Eurozone economy. The commission's report states that the global economic uncertainty and trade tensions are the main reasons for the downward revision of the growth forecast. The report also states that the European economy is expected to grow at a rate of 0.4% in 2025 and 0.2% in 2026, compared to the previous forecast of 1.3% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. The commission's report also forecasts that the inflation rate will decrease to 1.9% in 2026, from 2.3% in 2023. European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis stated that the European economy is showing resilience in the face of high trade tensions and increasing global uncertainty. He also stated that the growth forecast for 2025 is expected to be 1.1%, and that the inflation rate is expected to decrease to 1.9% in 2026. Dombrovskis also stated that the risks to the economic forecast are downward, and that the European Union should take steps to increase its competitiveness.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 10:05 AM\nSource:[Son Dakika](https://www.sondakika.com/ekonomi/haber-ab-ekonomi-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize--18648430/)\n\n**EU Revises Growth Forecast for Italy and Eurozone**\nThe European Commission has revised its growth forecast for the Italian economy, predicting 0.7% growth in 2025 and 0.9% in 2026, down from 1% and 1.2% respectively in the autumn forecast. The Commission also expects the Italian deficit to decrease from 3.4% of GDP in 2024 to 3.3% in 2025 and 2.9% in 2026. However, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase, reaching 136.7% in 2025 and 138.2% in 2026. The Commission has also revised its growth forecast for the Eurozone, predicting 0.9% growth in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, down from 1.3% and 1.6% respectively in the autumn forecast. The Commission attributes this revision to the weakening of global trade prospects and increased uncertainty over trade policies. 'The risks for the outlook are tilted to the downside', the Commission states, citing the risk of further fragmentation of global trade and the potential for climate-related disasters. On the positive side, a further easing of trade tensions between the EU and the US or a more rapid expansion of EU trade with other countries could support growth. The EU economy has started 2025 on a slightly more solid footing than expected, the Commission says, and will continue to grow at a moderate pace this year, with an acceleration expected in 2026, despite the increase in global policy uncertainty and trade tensions. Inflation is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026 in the euro area, and to a similar extent in the EU, with a decline of less than 2% in 2026. The EU's economic growth is expected to be 0.4% higher than expected in the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by domestic demand, and this momentum has continued into the first quarter of 2025 (+0.3%). However, the current forecasts revise the growth prospects downward due to the worsening of global trade and political uncertainty. The global growth outside the EU is expected to be 3.2% in 2025-2026, down from 3.6% estimated in the autumn. The EU's exports are expected to grow only 0.7% this year, driven by services. Investments are expected to increase by 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, supported by the Recovery Fund and the Cohesion Fund. Private consumption is expected to grow by 1.5% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. The labor market remains solid, with 1.7 million jobs created in 2024, and a further 2 million expected. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a historic low of 5.7% in 2026. The inflation is expected to fall and could reach the 2% target already in 2025, supported by the decline in energy prices and the strengthening of the euro. The EU's public deficit is expected to rise slightly to 3.3% in 2025-2026. The debt is expected to rise to 83.2% of GDP in 2025 and 84.5% in 2026. The Commission has also revised its growth forecast for Germany, predicting 0% growth this year (after a decline of 0.2% in 2024) and 1.1% growth in 2026, down from 0.7% growth this year and 1.3% growth next year. The Commission attributes this revision to weak exports, weak consumption, global uncertainty and unfavorable financial conditions. Among other major EU economies, France is expected to grow 0.6% and 1.3% in 2026, Spain 2.6% and 2% in 2026. This year, Malta (+4.1%) and Ireland (+3.4%) will grow more than the others.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 09:54 AM\nSource:[ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/economia/2025/05/19/lue-taglia-la-stima-sul-pil-dellitalia-07-nel-2025-09-nel-2026_d384818e-bb75-476c-ae45-3af09b0e9117.html)\n\n**EU Revises Economic Growth Forecast Downward Due to Tariffs and Trade Uncertainty**\nThe European Commission has revised its forecast for the economic growth of the European Union (EU) for 2025 and 2026. The main reasons for the revision are the new import tariffs and increased uncertainty caused by the rapid changes in US trade policy. According to the report, the EU's GDP growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2025, down from the previous forecast of 1.5%. The forecast for 2026 has also been revised downward to 1.5% from 1.8%. However, the Commission expects the economic growth of the EU to accelerate to 1.5% in 2026, driven by an increase in consumption and investment. The inflation rate is expected to decrease faster than previously forecast, with consumer prices (HICP index) increasing by 2.3% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. The economy of the eurozone is expected to grow by 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, down from the previous forecasts of 1.3% and 1.6%. The unemployment rate in the EU is expected to remain at 5.9% in 2025 and decrease to 5.7% in 2026. In the eurozone, it is expected to decrease gradually from 6.4% in 2024 to 6.1% in 2026. The budget deficit of EU countries is expected to increase, with a deficit of 3.3% of GDP in 2025 and 3.4% in 2026. The public debt-to-GDP ratio in the EU is expected to reach 84.5% by 2026, up from 82% in 2024. The forecast for the GDP of individual countries has also been revised. Germany's economy is not expected to grow in 2025, but is expected to increase by 1.1% in 2026. France's GDP is expected to grow by 0.6% and 1.3%, Italy's by 0.7% and 0.9%, and Spain's by 2.6% and 2%.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 05:50 PM\nSource:[\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Neftegaz.ru](https://neftegaz.ru/news/finance/889150-ek-snizila-prognoz-rosta-vvp-es-na-2025-g-iz-za-poshlin-i-neopredelennosti/)\n\n**EU Economic Growth Projections Reduced Due to US Tariffs and Uncertainty**\nThe European Commission has lowered its economic growth projections for the European Union (EU) due to the impact of increased US tariffs and persistent uncertainty. According to the Spring 2025 Economic Projections, the Commission reduced its real GDP growth forecasts for the 27-country bloc to 1.1% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, down from 1.5% and 1.8% respectively in the autumn 2024 report. The Commission stated, 'This represents a considerable downward revision compared to the autumn 2024 projections, largely due to the impact of the tariff increase and the greater uncertainty caused by the recent abrupt changes in US commercial policy and the unpredictability of the final tariff configuration.' The eurozone, comprising 20 EU countries that share a single currency, is expected to grow at 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, also below previous estimates.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 01:09 PM\nSource:[\u65b0\u534e\u7f51](http://spanish.xinhuanet.com/20250519/6c76677b89494adea026e0870701be3b/c.html)\n\n**EU Economic Growth Projections Revised Downward**\nThe European Commission's 'European Economic Projections 2025 Spring' report has been published.

The report forecasts that the EU economy will grow by 1.1% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, while the Eurozone economy is expected to grow by 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. This is a downward revision of the Commission's previous 'autumn' report, which forecasted growth of 1.5% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026 for the EU, and 1.3% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026 for the Eurozone. The report states, 'The current forecast has been significantly revised downwards, mainly due to the weakening global trade outlook and high uncertainty related to trade policy.'\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 12:43 PM\nSource:[HABERTURK.COM](https://www.haberturk.com/ab-2025-yili-ekonomik-buyume-tahminini-dusurdu-3792233-ekonomi)\n\n**European Commission Revises 2025 and 2026 Growth Forecasts Downward**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 downward due to global trade tensions and increasing uncertainties. The growth forecast for the Eurozone has been revised from 1.3% to 0.9% for this year, while inflation is expected to continue its downward trend. The European Commission's '2025 Spring European Economic Forecasts' report states that the EU's economy is stronger than expected at the beginning of the year, but global trade tensions and uncertainties are slowing down growth. The report predicts that the EU's economy will grow by 1.1% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. For the Eurozone, the growth rate is expected to be 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. This is a significant decrease from the previous forecast of 1.3% and 1.6%. The revision is attributed to the slowdown in global trade flows and high levels of ongoing trade policy uncertainty. According to the report, Austria's economy is expected to shrink by 0.3% in 2025, while Germany's economy is expected to remain stagnant. France is expected to grow by 0.6%, Italy by 0.7%, and Spain by 2.6% in 2025, while in 2026, Germany is expected to grow by 1.1%, France by 1.3%, Italy by 0.9%, and Spain by 2%. Inflation is expected to be 2.3% in 2025 for the EU and 2.1% for the Eurozone, while in 2026, these rates are expected to decrease to 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively. The report also notes that the US's new tariffs have had a significant impact on global markets, and that the uncertainty surrounding trade policies has increased the pressure on the global economy, affecting the EU directly. The report concludes that the EU's exports will be slowed down by the global demand weakness, and that the trade tensions will continue to have a negative impact on the EU's economy. The report also warns that the commercial fragmentation can have negative effects on growth and that there is a risk of re-emerging inflationary pressures. The report also mentions Turkey's economy, stating that the country's economy is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2025 and 3.5% in 2026, due to the effects of tight monetary and fiscal policies, as well as the decline in energy prices. The report also predicts that Turkey's budget deficit will decrease and its public debt will remain at a reasonable level. European Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis stated in a press conference in Brussels that the European economy is resilient despite the increasing global uncertainties. He also stated that inflation has declined faster than expected and that growth will continue at a moderate pace. He warned that the risks are still downward and that the EU needs to take decisive steps to increase its competitiveness. 'The outlook is still subject to risks, and therefore, we need to take bold steps to increase our competitiveness within the EU.' he said. \nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 12:36 PM\nSource:[birgun.net](https://www.birgun.net/haber/ab-komisyonu-2025-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize-etti-624219)\n\n**EU Economy Losing Steam, Commissioner Warns**\nValdis Dombrovskis, European Commissioner for Economy, stated that the European economy is losing steam and that only swift action can prevent the EU from lagging behind global growth. The European Commission has revised down its growth forecasts for the European economy, in a scenario marked by global uncertainty and trade tensions, particularly with the US. 'Global uncertainty and tensions are weighing on the growth of the European Union', said Dombrovskis, highlighting that, despite the challenges, 'the European economy remains resilient'. The Commission now expects the EU's GDP to grow by only 1.1% in 2025, a downward revision of 0.7 percentage points from the previously forecast 1.5%, and projects an acceleration to 1.5% in 2026. In the Eurozone, growth will be 0.9% this year, rising to 1.4% next year. 'This downward revision of 0.7 percentage points in accumulated terms for 2025-26 is mainly due to the impact of the tariff increase and the uncertainty caused by the abrupt changes in US commercial policy', explained Dombrovskis. The Commissioner warned that 'tensions in trade between the US and the EU, and between the US and China, can depress GDP growth and rekindle inflationary pressures'. On the other hand, 'a relaxation of trade tensions or a faster expansion of EU trade can help sustain growth'. Dombrovskis emphasized that 'the moment for the EU to act is now.' The Commissioner pointed out that 'the deterioration of global trade as a central element of the cut in EU and global GDP growth forecasts.' 'The global growth outside the EU is now projected at 3.2% for 2025 and 2026, a downward revision of 0.4 percentage points from the autumn', revealed Dombrovskis. Despite the slowdown, the European labor market remains robust. 'More jobs are being created and real wages are rising. This means more Europeans working and more money in their pockets', said the Commissioner. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a new historical low of 5.7% in 2026, with the creation of an additional two million jobs by then. 'Tight labor markets and productivity recovery are supporting wage growth', he said, adding that 'real wages are expected to fully recover the lost purchasing power in most member states'. Inflation is decelerating more rapidly than expected in the European space, Dombrovskis noted. 'Inflation is falling faster than expected, driven by the decline in energy prices', he indicated, detailing that the rate in the euro area is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026. In the EU, inflation is expected to follow a similar trajectory, falling to 1.9% in 2026. 'Several factors are exerting downward pressure on inflation, including the appreciation of the euro and increased price competition in non-energy goods', he explained. On the investment side, the recovery will be 'more timid than expected', with gross fixed capital formation growing 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, after a contraction of 1.9% in 2024. 'High uncertainty and tight financial conditions continue to hold back investment', warned Dombrovskis, arguing that 'more investment means a more prosperous and competitive European economy'. In the chapter on public finances, the EU's budget deficit is expected to increase slightly to 3.3% of GDP in 2025, remaining at that level in 2026, while the debt ratio rises modestly due to the increase in financing costs and the slowdown in nominal growth. However, Dombrovskis clarified that 'the impact of the application of the national escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact, which can allow for greater expenditure in defense, is not yet reflected in the forecasts', he clarified.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 11:29 AM\nSource:[ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/05/19/o-momento-da-europa-para-agir-e-agora/)\n\n**EU Economic Growth Forecast Revised Downwards to 0.9% in 2025**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth forecast for the Eurozone to 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, down from 1.3% and 1.6% respectively in the previous forecast. The Commission attributes this to the weakening of global trade prospects and increased uncertainty over trade policies. 'The risks for the prospects are oriented downwards', says the European Commission. The Commission also notes that an additional fragmentation of global trade could mitigate economic growth and rekindle inflationary pressures. On the positive side, a further easing of tensions between the EU and the US or a faster expansion of EU trade with other countries could support EU growth. The EU economy has started 2025 on a slightly more solid basis than expected, according to the Commission, and will continue to grow at a moderate pace this year, with an acceleration expected in 2026, despite the increase in global economic uncertainty and trade tensions. Inflation is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026 in the euro area. The EU's economic growth is expected to be similar, with a decline in inflation to just under 2% in 2026. The EU economy has recorded a growth of 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, above expectations, thanks to internal demand. This momentum has continued into the first quarter of 2025 (+0.3%). However, current forecasts revise downwards the growth prospects due to the worsening of global trade and political uncertainty. The global growth outside the EU is expected to be 3.2% in 2025-2026, down from 3.6% estimated in autumn. EU exports are expected to grow only 0.7% this year, driven by services. Investments, in a slight recovery after -1.8% in 2024, are expected to increase by 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, supported also by the Recovery Fund and the Cohesion Fund. Private consumption is expected to grow by 1.5% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. The labor market remains solid: 1.7 million jobs created in 2024, with an additional 2 million expected. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a historic low of 5.7% in 2026. Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said, 'The uncertainty on the global economic policy has reached levels never seen since the Covid-19 pandemic.' He added, 'The logic behind the US announcements on tariffs is unpredictable and apparently arbitrary, and has led to unprecedented levels of uncertainty on the global economic policy.' 'Since January, the new US administration has increased tariffs on imports from an increasing number of partner countries and on specific goods. The average tariff rate applied by the US on imports is today higher than at any other time since the 1930s.' 'The US announcements in April have also caused very high levels of market volatility. This market volatility remains high and the sentiment is fragile, as a great uncertainty on US trade and economic policy still looms,' he concluded.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 10:47 AM\nSource:[Il Messaggero](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/economia/news/dazi_ue_riduce_stime_pil_cosa_succede-8845536.html)\n\n**European Commission Revises Down Economic Growth Forecasts for Eurozone**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth forecasts for the Eurozone downwards. The commission has lowered its forecast for this year's economic growth to 0.9% from 1.3%, and for next year to 1.4% from 1.6%. The commission's 'Spring 2025 Economic Forecast' report states that the European economy is expected to grow at a rate of 1.1% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, while the Eurozone economy is expected to grow at a rate of 0.9% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. The commission's previous 'autumn' report had forecasted a growth rate of 1.5% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026 for the European economy, and 1.3% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026 for the Eurozone economy. The commission's report states that the global economic uncertainty and trade tensions are the main reasons for the downward revision of the growth forecast. The report also states that the European economy is expected to grow at a rate of 0.4% in 2025 and 0.2% in 2026, compared to the previous forecast of 1.3% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. The commission's report also forecasts that the inflation rate will decrease to 1.9% in 2026, from 2.3% in 2023. European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis stated that the European economy is showing resilience in the face of high trade tensions and increasing global uncertainty. He also stated that the growth forecast for 2025 is expected to be 1.1%, and that the inflation rate is expected to decrease to 1.9% in 2026. Dombrovskis also stated that the risks to the economic forecast are downward, and that the European Union should take steps to increase its competitiveness.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 10:05 AM\nSource:[Son Dakika](https://www.sondakika.com/ekonomi/haber-ab-ekonomi-buyume-tahminlerini-asagi-yonlu-revize--18648430/)\n\n**EU Revises Growth Forecast for Italy and Eurozone**\nThe European Commission has revised its growth forecast for the Italian economy, predicting 0.7% growth in 2025 and 0.9% in 2026, down from 1% and 1.2% respectively in the autumn forecast. The Commission also expects the Italian deficit to decrease from 3.4% of GDP in 2024 to 3.3% in 2025 and 2.9% in 2026. However, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase, reaching 136.7% in 2025 and 138.2% in 2026. The Commission has also revised its growth forecast for the Eurozone, predicting 0.9% growth in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, down from 1.3% and 1.6% respectively in the autumn forecast. The Commission attributes this revision to the weakening of global trade prospects and increased uncertainty over trade policies. 'The risks for the outlook are tilted to the downside', the Commission states, citing the risk of further fragmentation of global trade and the potential for climate-related disasters. On the positive side, a further easing of trade tensions between the EU and the US or a more rapid expansion of EU trade with other countries could support growth. The EU economy has started 2025 on a slightly more solid footing than expected, the Commission says, and will continue to grow at a moderate pace this year, with an acceleration expected in 2026, despite the increase in global policy uncertainty and trade tensions. Inflation is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2024 to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026 in the euro area, and to a similar extent in the EU, with a decline of less than 2% in 2026. The EU's economic growth is expected to be 0.4% higher than expected in the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by domestic demand, and this momentum has continued into the first quarter of 2025 (+0.3%). However, the current forecasts revise the growth prospects downward due to the worsening of global trade and political uncertainty. The global growth outside the EU is expected to be 3.2% in 2025-2026, down from 3.6% estimated in the autumn. The EU's exports are expected to grow only 0.7% this year, driven by services. Investments are expected to increase by 1.5% in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026, supported by the Recovery Fund and the Cohesion Fund. Private consumption is expected to grow by 1.5% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. The labor market remains solid, with 1.7 million jobs created in 2024, and a further 2 million expected. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to a historic low of 5.7% in 2026. The inflation is expected to fall and could reach the 2% target already in 2025, supported by the decline in energy prices and the strengthening of the euro. The EU's public deficit is expected to rise slightly to 3.3% in 2025-2026. The debt is expected to rise to 83.2% of GDP in 2025 and 84.5% in 2026. The Commission has also revised its growth forecast for Germany, predicting 0% growth this year (after a decline of 0.2% in 2024) and 1.1% growth in 2026, down from 0.7% growth this year and 1.3% growth next year. The Commission attributes this revision to weak exports, weak consumption, global uncertainty and unfavorable financial conditions. Among other major EU economies, France is expected to grow 0.6% and 1.3% in 2026, Spain 2.6% and 2% in 2026. This year, Malta (+4.1%) and Ireland (+3.4%) will grow more than the others.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 09:54 AM\nSource:[ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/economia/2025/05/19/lue-taglia-la-stima-sul-pil-dellitalia-07-nel-2025-09-nel-2026_d384818e-bb75-476c-ae45-3af09b0e9117.html)\n\n**European Commission revises downward growth forecasts for Italy and euro area**\nThe European Commission has revised downward its growth forecasts for Italy and the euro area. The Commission predicts that Italy's GDP will grow by 0.7% in 2025 and 0.9% in 2026, down from the previous forecast of 1% and 1.2% respectively. The Commission attributes the downward revision to the weakening of global trade prospects and increased uncertainty over commercial policies. The Commission also expects the Italian deficit to continue to decline, from 3.4% of GDP in 2024 to 3.3% in 2025 and 2.9% in 2026. However, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase, reaching 136.7% in 2025 and 138.2% in 2026. 'The economy is showing resilience despite the strong commercial tensions and the increase in global uncertainty,' said EU Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis. 'We expect the growth to continue in 2025, albeit at a moderate pace. Inflation is decreasing more rapidly than previously expected and is on track to reach the 2% target this year. However, we cannot lower our guard.

The EU economy grew by 0.4% in the last quarter of 2024, driven by a robust internal demand. However, the first quarter of 2025 saw a growth of only 0.3% in real GDP. The Commission's spring forecasts are based on some assumptions about tariffs. 'In the model, it was assumed that the tariffs on US imports of goods from the EU and almost all other trading partners would remain at 10%, the level applied on April 9, except for the higher tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars (25%) and the tariff exemptions on some products (pharmaceuticals and microprocessors). It was assumed that the bilateral tariffs between the US and China would be lower than those applied on April 9, but high enough to lead to a significant reduction in bilateral trade in goods between the US and China. The tariffs agreed upon by China and the US on May 12 turned out to be lower than those assumed, but still high enough to not invalidate the assumption of a negative impact on trade relations between the US and China.' As a result, global growth outside the EU is now expected to be 3.2% for both 2025 and 2026, down from the 3.6% expected in the autumn of 2024. 'This downward revision reflects in large part a weakening of prospects for both the US and China. The slowdown in global trade is even more marked.' Consequently, the Commission expects EU exports to grow only 0.7% this year, with a new contraction in goods exports partially offset by the resilience of service exports, which are less influenced by trade tensions. In 2026, export growth is expected to accelerate to 2.1%. The uncertainty of tariffs also weighs on internal demand and investment. 'As for private consumption, a slightly more robust growth is expected than in the autumn', supported 'by a still resilient labor market.'\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 19, 2025 09:09 AM\nSource:[SIR - Servizio Informazione Religiosa](https://www.agensir.it/quotidiano/2025/5/19/commissione-ue-previsioni-economiche-prospettive-peggiorate-i-dazi-pesano-sul-commercio-internazionale/)\n\n**EU Trade Commissioner: EU's Economic Growth Forecast Remains Pessimistic**\nEuropean Commission Executive Vice President and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis stated that the recent trade truce between the US and China, which involves a mutual reduction of tariffs, is a step in the right direction, but the high tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese products still pose a significant risk. The EU has been concerned that China may divert its exports from the US to the EU due to the high tariffs, which could have a negative impact on the EU's economic growth and investment prospects. Dombrovskis emphasized that the EU's economic growth forecast for this year remains pessimistic due to the uncertainty caused by the US tariffs. The EU will release its spring economic forecast on May 19, which is expected to revise downward its GDP growth forecast for this year. The EU's previous forecast in autumn last year predicted a 0.9% GDP growth rate for this year and 1.5% for next year. However, the forecast is expected to be revised downward due to the impact of US tariffs.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 13, 2025 11:32 PM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E5%9B%BD%E9%99%85/20250513-%E6%AC%A7%E7%9B%9F%E8%B4%B8%E6%98%93%E4%B8%93%E5%91%98-%E6%AC%A7%E7%9B%9F%E4%BB%8A%E5%B9%B4%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E%E5%A2%9E%E9%95%BF%E9%A2%84%E6%9C%9F%E4%BB%8D%E6%82%B2%E8%A7%82)\n\n**EU Economic Growth Forecast Revised Down Amid US Tariffs Concerns**\nThe European Commission's Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis has expressed optimism about the US-China trade truce, saying it is a step in the right direction, but notes that US tariffs remain high, which will likely lead to a pessimistic economic growth forecast for this year. The European Commission will release its spring economic forecast data next Monday, and Dombrovskis has announced that it will revise down its annual economic growth rate forecast for this year. The Commission's economic predictions are released twice a year, and last autumn's prediction was a 0.9% growth rate for the EU's GDP in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025. However, due to the impact of US tariffs, the prediction will be significantly revised. Dombrovskis said that the EU economy had a stronger foundation at the end of last year than initially expected, and maintained its momentum at the beginning of this year, but US tariffs and the uncertainty they bring will have a negative impact on the EU's economic growth and investment prospects this year. He also noted that the EU's concerns about trade diversion, where countries may shift their exports from the US to the EU due to high US tariffs, have been slightly alleviated by the US-China trade truce, but the risk remains, and the Commission has announced that it will release a report on trade diversion risks in May.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 13, 2025 04:18 PM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5599/8738001)\n\n**IMF Downgrades Global Economic Forecast Due to Trade Tensions and Political Uncertainty**\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its forecast for the global economy downward, citing the impact of trade tensions and high levels of political uncertainty. The IMF predicts that the global GDP will grow at 2.8% in 2025 and 3% in 2026, down from the previous forecast of 3.3% for both years. This represents a revision of five-tenths of a percentage point downward for this year and three-tenths of a percentage point for next year. The IMF notes that the rapid escalation of trade tensions and extremely high levels of political uncertainty will have a significant impact on the global economy. The US economy is expected to grow at 1.8% in 2025, down from the previous forecast of 2.7%, due to the impact of tariffs and a weaker-than-expected increase in consumption. The IMF also reduced its forecast for China's GDP, predicting a growth rate of 4% in 2025 and 2026, down from the previous forecast of 5% and 5.3% respectively. The IMF also reduced its forecast for the eurozone, predicting a growth rate of 0.8% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026. However, the IMF notes that the Spanish economy is expected to grow at 2.5% in 2025, up from the previous forecast of 2.3%, due to a strong performance in 2024 and the reconstruction efforts after the floods in Valencia last October. 'The increase in uncertainty and tariffs are the main drivers of the weak growth in 2025', said the IMF. 'However, there are several factors that will compensate for that scenario and drive the modest rebound in growth in 2026, such as a stronger consumption due to the increase in real wages and the relaxation of fiscal rules in Germany.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: April 22, 2025 01:00 PM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/invertia/economia/macroeconomia/20250422/fmi-aplica-gran-recorte-economia-baja-decimas-pib-mundial-eeuu-solo-mejora-espana/1003743723998_0.html)\n\n**UK Downgrades 2025 Economic Growth Forecast to 1%**\nThe UK government has significantly lowered its economic growth forecast for 2025 to 1%, a drastic cut from the 2% prediction made in October last year.

UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak expressed dissatisfaction with the current economic growth data, emphasizing that the government will continue to implement long-term strategies to promote economic growth and improve living standards. The OBR predicts that the UK's economic growth rate will rebound to 1.9% in 2026, followed by a steady 1.7% to 1.8% growth rate from 2027 to 2029. The OBR also warned that uncertainty surrounding US trade policies could significantly impact the UK economy. If global trade disputes escalate and lead to a 20% increase in tariffs between the US and Europe, the UK's GDP could contract by 1%, resulting in a near-zero fiscal surplus.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 26, 2025 10:31 PM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202503273357173521.html)\n\n**OECD revises global economic growth forecast downward**\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has revised its forecast for global economic growth, predicting a slowdown from 3.2% in 2024 to 3.1% in 2025 and 3.0% in 2026. The OECD attributed the downward revision to 'increased trade barriers in several G20 economies and greater geopolitical and policy uncertainty weighing on investment and household spending.' The organization warned that a further increase in trade barriers would hinder global growth and contribute to inflationary pressures. According to the OECD, the US economy is expected to grow at 2.2% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026, with the implementation of tariffs. The eurozone is expected to grow at 1% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026, with increased uncertainty moderating the expansion. Germany, France, and Italy are expected to experience economic growth below 1% in 2025, while Spain is expected to grow at 2.6% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. The OECD also expects inflation to remain higher than previously anticipated, but to moderate as economic growth slows. In the G20 economies, inflation is expected to decrease from 3.8% in 2025 to 3.2% in 2026. In the eurozone, inflation is expected to decrease from 2.3% in 2024 to 2.2% in 2025 and 2% in 2026. However, in the US, inflation is expected to increase from 2.5% in 2024 to 2.8% in 2025. The OECD warned that a resurgence of inflation or slower-than-expected economic growth could generate volatility in financial markets. It also warned that new bilateral tariffs and increasing geopolitical and policy uncertainty would weigh on business investment and trade, while the increase in trade costs could exert greater upward pressure on consumer prices. 'Growing protectionism, geopolitical uncertainty, and weak growth prospects reinforce the need for ambitious structural reforms to ensure the health of internal markets,' the OECD added.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 12:28 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u534e\u7f51](http://spanish.xinhuanet.com/20250318/6d14e583b4914a6a8567a3552912cf1a/c.html)\n\n**OECD revises global economic growth forecast downward for 2025**\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has revised its forecast for global economic growth in 2025 downward, citing uncertainty and tensions in the global economy. 'We are navigating turbulent waters', said Alvaro Santos Pereira, the OECD's chief economist, summarizing the global economic situation. The OECD now predicts a 3.1% growth in the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2025, down from its previous forecast of 3.3% in December. The United States, which has threatened to engage in a trade war with its main trading partners, is expected to grow by 2.2% this year and 1.6% next year, according to the OECD. The organization has lowered its forecast for US economic growth in 2025 and 2026 by 0.2 and 0.5 percentage points, respectively. The aggressive trade policies pursued by the US are particularly affecting its neighbors, Canada and Mexico, whose growth forecasts have plummeted: Canada's growth is expected to be 0.7% in 2025, down from 2.3% in December, while Mexico is expected to enter a recession this year, according to the OECD. The OECD attributes the downward revision to the ongoing trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties affecting many countries. The OECD notes that the growth in the US, Mexico, and Canada 'will slow down as tariffs come into effect'. The organization has only taken into account the new tariffs between the US, Canada, and Mexico, as well as the tariffs on steel and aluminum, but not the threatened reciprocal tariffs mentioned by Trump or those related to the European Union. Despite this, the OECD has revised its growth forecast for 2025 downward for Germany and France, the largest and second-largest economies in the eurozone, for the second consecutive time. The OECD now expects Germany's GDP to grow by 0.4% this year, down from 0.7% in its previous forecast, while France's growth is expected to be 0.8% this year, 0.1 percentage points less than in December. 'European economies will suffer fewer direct economic effects' from the trade measures included in the OECD's projections, 'but the increase in geopolitical and political uncertainty should, nonetheless, slow down growth', explains the organization. Only Spain is expected to experience sustained growth, with a forecast of 2.6% in 2025. Japan's growth forecast for 2025 has also been revised downward to 1.1%, a 0.4 percentage point decrease. China's growth is expected to reach 4.8% in 2025, with little change from the December forecast. 'The negative consequences of the imposition of tariffs are largely offset by the adoption of reinforced support measures', notes the OECD. The OECD warns of the negative impact of trade tensions on global trade, which could not only slow down global production but also exacerbate inflation.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 17, 2025 11:55 AM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/agencias/2025/03/17/la-ocde-revisa-a-la-baja-el-crecimiento-mundial-en-2025-en-un-contexto-de-tensiones-comerciales-208735)\n\n**ECB's Macroeconomic Projections for the Euro Area: Uncertainty and Challenges Ahead**\nAccording to the European Central Bank's (ECB) macroeconomic projections for the euro area, the high uncertainty surrounding the geopolitical situation and economic and trade policies will negatively impact the expected economic growth. This is a consequence of the slightly weaker-than-expected economic growth at the end of 2024. The uncertainty related to both internal and external policies is high. Although the baseline projections only take into account the impact of new US-China trade tariffs, it is assumed that the negative effects of uncertainty related to possible further changes in global trade policies, especially towards the European Union, will affect exports and investments in the euro area. It is estimated that, combined with the ongoing challenges in terms of competitiveness, this will lead to a further decline in the euro area's share of export markets. Despite these unfavorable factors, the conditions remain in place for a renewed increase in the dynamics of GDP in the euro area in the projection horizon. It is expected that the growth will be driven by rising real wages and employment growth - with a strong, albeit slowing, labor market - and that consumption will remain a key driver of growth. The internal demand is expected to support the easing of financing conditions, reflected in market expectations of the future path of interest rates. The labor market is expected to remain resilient - with an average unemployment rate of 6.3% in 2025, followed by a decline to 6.2% in 2027. It is projected that productivity will grow in line with the fading of some cyclical factors that have weakened its dynamics in recent periods. However, structural problems persist. Overall, the average annual growth rate of real GDP is expected to be 0.9% in 2025, followed by an increase to 1.2% in 2026 and 1.3% in 2027. Compared to the ECB's macroeconomic projections from December 2024, the prospects for GDP growth in 2025 and 2026 have been revised down by 0.2 percentage points, but the 2027 projection remains unchanged. The weaker prospects are mainly due to a downward revision of exports and, to a lesser extent, a downward revision of investment projections. These revisions reflect the stronger-than-expected impact of uncertainty and expectations that the challenges related to competitiveness will persist longer than previously expected. \nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: March 10, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/projections/html/ecb.projections202503_ecbstaff~106050a4fa.pl.html)\n\n**Lagarde: Economic Uncertainty Weighs on Exports and Investments**\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde stated, 'The downward revisions to the euro area's GDP growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 reflect the decline in exports and the continued weakness in investments, partly due to the high uncertainty surrounding commercial and economic policies.' This uncertainty is affecting the export and investment sectors, leading to a decrease in growth forecasts.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 07, 2025 12:27 PM\nSource:[Quotidiano Libero](https://www.liberoquotidiano.it/video/video-news-by-vista/41805230/lagarde-bce-incertezza-politiche-commerciali-pesa-su-export-e-investimenti.html)\n\n**European Commission Downgrades EU Growth Forecast Amid Uncertainty**\nThe European Commission has revised its growth forecast for the European Union downward, citing the impact of US protectionist policies and high uncertainty, particularly in trade policies. European Commissioner for Trade, Valdis Dombrovskis, warned that the international environment is becoming increasingly unpredictable. 'In general, we expect the EU economy to grow at a slower pace compared to what we projected in our autumn forecast', he said. The EU had previously forecasted a 0.9% growth in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025, but according to Eurostat, the actual growth rate is expected to be 0.9% in 2024. Dombrovskis emphasized that the uncertainty is 'high' and has increased significantly, particularly due to US trade policies, which 'limits investment and reduces external perspectives' for the European economy. He also noted that energy prices have increased again in recent months, affecting the economy's performance. 'However, despite all these challenges, the conditions for a gradual recovery of growth momentum throughout this year continue', he said. The Commissioner urged the Eurozone to prepare for an increasingly unpredictable international environment. 'We will need to make full use of our strengths and address our weaknesses with the utmost urgency. We will have to take more responsibility for our security and defense and improve our competitiveness and economic fundamentals', he listed. The European Commissioner also indicated that the Finance Ministers of the Eurozone countries have endorsed the fiscal orientation that should guide the member states. 'This year's recommendation emphasizes the urgent need to address the lagging productivity and innovation, highlighting the importance of continuing our efforts to increase the competitiveness of the Eurozone', he stressed. The recommendation also places a strong emphasis on the need to strengthen the Single Market.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 08:15 PM\nSource:[ECO](https://eco.sapo.pt/2025/02/17/mais-pessimista-sobre-crescimento-bruxelas-avisa-para-ambiente-internacional-imprevisivel/)\n\n**Eurozone Growth Predictions Revised Downward**\nThe European Commission has revised its economic growth predictions for the eurozone, stating that growth will be slightly lower than previously expected. According to Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis, the uncertainty surrounding the international scenario has increased, citing the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the potential for US President Donald Trump to impose tariffs. Pierre Gramegna, executive director of the European Stability Mechanism, noted that tariffs would make predictions even more unpredictable. The Commission has not released specific numbers, but estimates suggest a potential 0.1-0.2% decrease in growth for the EU and eurozone. The revised predictions for 2025 are 1.5% for the EU and 1.3% for the eurozone, down from previous estimates.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 06:18 PM\nSource:[eunews.it](https://www.eunews.it/2025/02/17/eurozona-crescita-piu-bassa-del-previsto/)\n\n\n\n\n# FORECASTS\n\n## R1: Forecaster 1 Reasoning\n(a) The Autumn 2025 forecast is likely around six months away, so that is when we will know the outcome.  \n(b) As of now, the Commission\u2019s official line for 2026 remains 1.5% with no announced decrease, so the status quo outcome is No.  \n(c) A No outcome could occur if the Autumn 2025 figure remains above 1.3% (for instance, dropping from 1.5% to 1.4%) or if no explicit mention of trade uncertainty is made.  \n(d) A Yes outcome would require the 2026 forecast to be at or below 1.3% and an explicit attribution to trade uncertainty and tariffs.  \n\nProbability: 60%  \n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 2 Reasoning\n(a) There are roughly six months to go until the usual publication window for the Autumn 2025 Economic Forecast, so the resolution is still pending.  \n(b) If nothing changed, the Commission would leave its 2026 EU GDP growth forecast at 1.5%, meaning no 0.2-point downgrade and thus a \u201cNo\u201d outcome.  \n(c) A plausible \u201cNo\u201d scenario: The Commission lowers 2026 growth only slightly, say to 1.4%, or even keeps it at 1.5%, and thus fails to meet the 0.2-point revision threshold. Even if trade tensions are mentioned, the numerical criterion would not be satisfied.  \n(d) A plausible \u201cYes\u201d scenario: We see mounting trade disruptions, enough for the Commission to cut the 2026 outlook to 1.3% (or below), explicitly citing ongoing tariff and policy uncertainty as part of the rationale.  \n\nGiven that forecasts often move gradually, and 0.2% is a moderate but not huge shift, the probability that both conditions are met is neither negligible nor overwhelming. After weighing present uncertainties and the Commission\u2019s stated concerns about trade tensions, I estimate:  \n\nProbability: 60%  \n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 3 Reasoning\n(a) Time left until we know: Around six months remain, as the Autumn 2025 Forecast is typically released in November.  \n(b) Status quo outcome: Right now, the Commission\u2019s baseline for 2026 is still 1.5% growth, with trade tensions acknowledged but not yet prompting a downward revision below 1.3%.  \n(c) A likely No scenario: The Commission revises 2026 growth modestly downward (e.g., 1.4%), or fails to list trade uncertainty among the primary reasons for the revision, so the 0.2 percentage-point drop and explicit mention of trade risk do not both materialize.  \n(d) A likely Yes scenario: Global trade frictions deepen (e.g., further tariff escalations), prompting the Commission to cut the 2026 forecast to 1.3% or below and explicitly cite these heightened trade risks as a key factor driving the revision.  \n\nProbability: 65%  \n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 4 Reasoning\n(a) The Autumn 2025 forecast is typically released in early November, so there are about five to six months left before we know the official outcome.\n\n(b) Currently, the Commission\u2019s 2026 forecast stands at 1.5%. If nothing significant changes in trade policy or the broader outlook, the Commission might leave it at 1.5% or revise only slightly above 1.3%, and/or not explicitly cite trade uncertainty as a key reason.\n\n(c) A scenario yielding a No: Trade frictions calm down or remain marginal, so the EU Commission sees little change to the medium-term outlook and revises 2026 growth only slightly\u2014say, to 1.4%\u2014with minimal mention of tariffs or trade uncertainty.\n\n(d) A scenario yielding a Yes: Trade tensions worsen (e.g., more US-EU tariffs or broader spillovers), weakening external demand enough that the Commission cuts the 2026 EU growth forecast to 1.3% or below and points to trade-policy risks as a central driver of that downgrade.\n\nProbability: 60%\n\n\n## R1: Forecaster 5 Reasoning\n(a) We have about half a year to go (roughly six months) until the Autumn 2025 forecast is released, which is when the question will be definitively answered.\n\n(b) Under a status quo scenario with little further escalation in tariffs or new shocks, the European Commission might maintain its current 1.5% estimate for 2026 or revise only slightly (e.g., to 1.4%), thereby falling short of the 0.2-point decrease criterion.\n\n(c) A \u201cNo\u201d outcome would occur if, for instance, the Commission\u2019s Autumn 2025 update lowers the 2026 forecast only to around 1.4%, or even 1.3% but omits explicit mention of trade/tariff uncertainty. Alternatively, they may leave the 2026 forecast unchanged at 1.5%, citing other factors (e.g., domestic demand or fiscal policies) rather than trade tensions.\n\n(d) A \u201cYes\u201d outcome would occur if the Commission lowers the 2026 forecast to 1.3% or below (e.g., 1.2%) and explicitly blames trade policy disruptions or tariffs as a key contributor. Continued US-EU tariff escalation or significant trade uncertainty would almost certainly prompt that downgrade and clear mention of its trade-related causes.\n\nProbability: 70%\n\n",

This is primarily attributed to increasing global trade tensions and uncertainties surrounding trade policies.\n\n*   The forecast now anticipates a growth rate of **1.1% for the EU in 2025** (down from 1.5%) and **1.5% in 2026** (down from 1.8%).\n*   For the Eurozone, growth is expected to be **0.9% in 2025** (down from 1.3%) and **1.4% in 2026** (down from 1.6%).\n\nThe report highlights that these downward revisions are significantly influenced by a weakening global trade outlook and high levels of uncertainty related to trade policy, particularly new U.S. tariffs.\n\nEuropean Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis emphasized that while the EU economy started the year stronger than expected, it faces challenges from global uncertainties that are weighing on growth. Inflation is projected to decrease, with rates expected to fall to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026 for the Eurozone. The overall economic environment remains fragile, with risks oriented downwards.

The final prediction is **60.0% probability** that the European Commission's Autumn 2025 Economic Forecast will revise the EU's 2026 real GDP growth forecast downwards by at least 0.2 percentage points compared to the Spring 2025 forecast, explicitly citing trade uncertainty as a contributing factor.\n\nThe research indicates that the European Commission has already revised growth projections downward for 2025 and 2026 in its Spring 2025 forecast due to global trade tensions, particularly US tariffs. The EU's 2026 growth forecast was revised from 1.8% down to 1.5% in the Spring. For the question to resolve as \"Yes,\" a further downward revision to 1.3% or lower in the Autumn 2025 forecast, with trade uncertainty explicitly cited, would be needed. Forecasters believe there is a 60% chance of this occurring.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?",

Bank runs are publicly understood economic phenomena. Individual/small community: If a trusted community receives a high-probability forecast, some members might preemptively withdraw funds[2](https://www.anticipation-hub.org/learn/emerging-topics/impact-based-forecasting)[5](https://www.forecast-based-financing.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Impact-based-forecasting-guide-2020.pdf). However, individual actions alone rarely trigger systemic bank runs. Society-level: Public knowledge of a high-probability forecast could create panic withdrawals through social contagion[5](https://www.forecast-based-financing.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Impact-based-forecasting-guide-2020.pdf), directly causing the predicted outcome (as seen in historical bank runs). This meets the \"toilet paper shortage\" precedent from the examples. Reframing: Alternatives focus on measurable economic indicators (liquidity ratios, unemployment data) that influence bank stability without directly predicting panic behavior[1](https://www.meted.ucar.edu/ibf/hazards/print.php)[3](https://www.meted.ucar.edu/emgmt/hazwx/navmenu.php?tab=3&page=4-5-0&type=flash).

However, nuclear-level weapons typically require state-level resources, limiting individual impact. Society-level self-fulfilling: Public knowledge of feasible superweapon methods could trigger arms races between nations[2](https://www.anticipation-hub.org/learn/emerging-topics/impact-based-forecasting)[5](https://www.forecast-based-financing.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Impact-based-forecasting-guide-2020.pdf), as seen in historical WMD proliferation patterns.

Effective teams leverage these differences to produce better results.\n\n5.  **Learn from Mistakes**: See mistakes as opportunities to learn. Systematically analyze them to build understanding and avoid repeating them.\n\n6.  **Systemize into Principles**: Develop a coherent set of principles that guide decisions and actions, ensuring consistent outcomes.\n\n7.  **Believability-Weighted Decision Making**: Consider opinions based on the track record and reliability of people sharing them, not just the opinion itself.\n\n8.  **Manage Risks**: Constantly assess potential risks and take proactive steps to mitigate them while balancing potential rewards.\n\n9.  **Strive for Excellence**: Aim for the highest standards in all areas of work and life, constantly seeking improvement and innovation.\n\n10. **Cultivate Meaningful Relationships**: Build and maintain strong, trustworthy relationships for both personal fulfillment and collective success.\n\n11. **Create a Culture of Radical Truth and Transparency**: Encourage open communication and honesty within an organization or group.\n\nThese principles reflect a systematic approach to decision-making and personal development, combining analytical rigor with an understanding of human nature and relationships. If you need more detailed insights on any specific principle, feel free to ask!",

U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)**\n- **Primary Source**: The BEA offers the most comprehensive U.S. GDP data, including:\n  - **National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) Historical Tables**: Annual and quarterly GDP data, revisions, and detailed breakdowns (e.g., consumption, investment, government spending)[2](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product)[9](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=147&step=2).\n  - **GDP by Industry**: Historical industry-specific contributions to GDP, available via a downloadable ZIP file[9](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=147&step=2).\n  - **Interactive Data Tools**: Customizable tables for filtering and exporting data[2](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product).\n\n### **2. Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)**\n- **Key Features**:\n  - **Nominal GDP**: Quarterly data in billions of dollars (seasonally adjusted annual rate), updated through Q1 2025[1](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP).\n  - **Real GDP**: Inflation-adjusted data in chained 2017 dollars, with historical records back to 1947[4](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1).\n  - **Export Options**: Downloadable in CSV, Excel, or other formats directly from the FRED platform[1](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP)[4](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1).\n\n### **3. World Bank Open Data**\n- **Global Context**: Provides U.S. GDP in current US dollars alongside international comparisons. Data is licensed under CC BY-4.0 for reuse[3](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US)[8](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD).\n\n### **4. Macrotrends & Trading Economics**\n- **Supplementary Sources**:\n  - **Macrotrends**: Annual GDP figures from 1960 to 2023 in a simplified chart format[7](https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/usa/united-states/gdp-gross-domestic-product).\n  - **Trading Economics**: Offers historical data, forecasts, and GDP growth rate details, though it primarily aggregates from the BEA and World Bank[5](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp)[6](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth).\n\n---\n\n**Recommended Workflow**:\n1. **For detailed U.S. economic analysis**: Use the BEA\u2019s NIPA tables[2](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product) or FRED\u2019s real GDP series[4](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1).\n2. **For international comparisons**: Download World Bank datasets[3](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US)[8](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD).\n3. **For industry-specific insights**: Access the BEA\u2019s GDP-by-Industry ZIP file[9](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=147&step=2).\n\n---\n\n\n\nTool output:\n\nThe US GDP forecast for 2027 projects moderate economic growth, with real GDP expected to expand by **1.8%** annually, according to key institutions like the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Federal Reserve[1](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61136)[2](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=326)[6](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20250319.pdf). Nominal GDP is anticipated to reach approximately **$29.2 trillion** (Trading Economics) to **$32.9 trillion** (Statista), depending on the methodology and inflation adjustments[5](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp)[7](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263591/gross-domestic-product-gdp-of-the-united-states/).\n\n### Key Projections:\n**Real GDP Growth:**\n- **1.8% annual growth** in 2027, consistent across CBO, Federal Reserve, and IMF projections[1](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61136)[2](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=326)[6](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20250319.pdf)[9](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/profile/USA).  \n- This follows slightly higher growth rates of 1.9% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026[1](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61136)[6](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20250319.pdf).\n\n**Nominal GDP:**\n- **$29.2 trillion** (Trading Economics)[5](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp) and **$32.9 trillion** (Statista)[7](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263591/gross-domestic-product-gdp-of-the-united-states/), reflecting differences in inflation assumptions or measurement frameworks.  \n- The CBO\u2019s long-term model suggests steady growth, with nominal GDP rising from $28.2 trillion in 2023 to $41.7 trillion by 2033[3](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216985/forecast-of-us-gross-domestic-product/).\n\n**Supporting Factors:**\n- The Federal Reserve\u2019s March 2025 projections highlight a stable unemployment rate of **4.3%** and controlled inflation (PCE inflation at **2.0%**) by 2027[2](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=326)[6](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20250319.pdf).  \n- Deloitte\u2019s analysis aligns with this outlook, forecasting a gradual slowdown in growth to **1.9% annually** post-2026[8](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/us-economic-forecast/united-states-outlook-analysis.html).\n\n### Risks and Context:\n- These projections assume no major economic shocks and continued stability in labor markets and monetary policy[2](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=326)[6](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20250319.pdf).  \n- Differences in nominal GDP estimates stem from varying inflation expectations and methodological approaches[5](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp)[7](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263591/gross-domestic-product-gdp-of-the-united-states/).\n\nIn summary, the US economy is expected to grow steadily but modestly through 2027, with real growth anchored near 1.8% and nominal GDP expanding to between $29 trillion and $33 trillion.\n\n---\n\n\n\nTool call:

The primary dataset used is the \"Real Gross Domestic Product\" (GDPC1) data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database. This dataset contains quarterly, seasonally adjusted real GDP values in billions of chained 2017 dollars, from 1947 to the present. The data was downloaded as a CSV file from the official FRED website at the following URL: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1).\n\nTo forecast the US GDP for 2027, two distinct modeling approaches were employed: a Monte Carlo simulation of a Geometric Brownian Motion and a Linear Regression on the logarithm of the historical GDP data. The Monte Carlo simulation, which is a more conservative model, yielded the following quantiles for 2027 GDP: the 10th percentile at \\$23.41 trillion, the 25th percentile at \\$23.63 trillion, the median (50th percentile) at \\$23.88 trillion, the 75th percentile at \\$24.14 trillion, and the 90th percentile at \\$24.39 trillion. In contrast, the Linear Regression model, which assumes a constant growth rate and is therefore more optimistic, predicted significantly higher values. For this model, the 10th percentile for 2027 GDP is \\$26.39 trillion, the 25th percentile is \\$27.63 trillion, the median is \\$29.09 trillion, the 75th percentile is \\$30.61 trillion, and the 90th percentile is \\$32.06 trillion. An attempt to use a third model, ARIMA, was unsuccessful.\n\nThe significant difference in the forecasts highlights the uncertainty inherent in economic predictions and the sensitivity of these predictions to the underlying model assumptions. The Linear Regression model extrapolates the long-term historical growth trend, which has been consistently positive. The Monte Carlo simulation, on the other hand, incorporates historical volatility, which results in a wider range of potential outcomes and a more conservative estimate. The historical data shows a consistent upward trend in US Real GDP, which justifies the use of forecasting models that project future growth. No visual analysis of graphs from the source was performed, as the focus was on a quantitative analysis of the downloaded data.\n\n",

This event represents a potential \"black swan\" for the industry, raising questions about the reliability of decentralized systems. Another significant development is the partnership between Webull and Kalshi, which brings regulated prediction markets to a mainstream retail audience and signals a move towards broader adoption. The increasing use of AI in forecasting across various sectors, from finance to energy, also emerged as a major trend. Finally, the articles consistently mentioned regulatory scrutiny as a persistent threat to the industry, with Polymarket facing cease and desist letters from multiple states.\\n\\nMy approach to crafting the questions was to focus on these key themes, aligning with the user\\'s request for a SWOT analysis-style breakdown of the field.

Judgmental forecasting relies on expert intuition and structured qualitative methods, while prediction markets use crowd-sourced trading to quantify event probabilities. Below is a detailed analysis of both domains.\n\n## Judgmental Forecasting: Key Methods and Developments\nJudgmental forecasting leverages human expertise, particularly when historical data is scarce or for unprecedented scenarios. Recent developments emphasize structured frameworks and hybrid approaches:\n\n- **Core Methods**:  \n  - **Expert-Based Forecasting**: Involves aggregating insights from domain specialists, weighted by reliability. This method is essential for new product launches (e.g., tech startups predicting wearable device adoption)[1](https://www.joinhomebase.com/blog/forecasting-models)[7](https://www.drivetrain.ai/post/judgement-based-sales-forecasting).  \n  - **Delphi Method**: Uses iterative expert panels to reach consensus, applied in long-term scenarios like pharmaceutical R&D investment decisions[1](https://www.joinhomebase.com/blog/forecasting-models).  \n  - **Scenario Analysis**: Models \"what-if\" cases (e.g., economic shifts or competitor actions) to stress-test forecasts, especially valuable in volatile markets[7](https://www.drivetrain.ai/post/judgement-based-sales-forecasting).  \n\n- **Recent Innovations**:  \n  Integration with **market research** (e.g., customer surveys) and **intuitive forecasting** from seasoned professionals enhances accuracy. Early-stage companies increasingly combine these to offset data limitations[7](https://www.drivetrain.ai/post/judgement-based-sales-forecasting)[9](https://otexts.com/fpp2/judgmental.html).  \n\n## Prediction Markets: Key Players and 2024\u20132025 Developments\nPrediction markets have surged in popularity, driven by political events and regulatory advancements. Key platforms include:\n\n- **Polymarket**:  \n  Dominates with over **$800M monthly trading volume**. It gained prominence during the 2024 U.S. election, where users wagered $2.5M on outcomes, signaling Trump's victory earlier than polls. Despite regulatory scrutiny (including an FBI raid), it remains a leader in event-based contracts[2](https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/12/prediction-markets-go-mainstream/)[5](https://www.fia.org/marketvoice/articles/predicting-future-prediction-markets)[8](https://time.com/collections/time100-companies-2025/7289591/polymarket/).  \n\n- **Kalshi**:  \n  The first **CFTC-regulated event contract exchange**, emphasizing structured \"yes/no\" outcomes. Co-founder Luana Lopes Lara notes its role in simplifying probabilistic trading for retail investors[5](https://www.fia.org/marketvoice/articles/predicting-future-prediction-markets).  \n\n- **Robinhood and ForecastEx**:  \n  Robinhood launched a prediction markets hub in 2025, attracting younger traders. ForecastEx introduced novel derivative structures for probability-based trading[5](https://www.fia.org/marketvoice/articles/predicting-future-prediction-markets)[8](https://time.com/collections/time100-companies-2025/7289591/polymarket/).  \n\n- **Good Judgment Inc.**:  \n  Uses **Superforecasters**\u2014non-experts trained in probabilistic reasoning\u2014who outperformed futures markets by **30%** in predicting Federal Reserve decisions (2024\u20132025). Their methodology combines crowd wisdom with machine learning refinement[4](https://goodjudgment.com)[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10502359/)[10](https://goodjudgment.com/about/press-news/).  \n\n### Technological and Regulatory Trends\n- **AI Integration**: Machine learning algorithms (e.g., Almanis platform) now weight human trades by accuracy, reducing prediction errors by 15\u201330%[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10502359/).  \n- **Regulatory Shifts**: The 2024 election catalyzed CFTC discussions on legalizing event contracts, though Polymarket's unregistered status highlights ongoing compliance challenges[5](https://www.fia.org/marketvoice/articles/predicting-future-prediction-markets)[8](https://time.com/collections/time100-companies-2025/7289591/polymarket/).  \n- **Mainstream Adoption**: Retail participation has exploded, with prediction markets becoming a \"gateway\" for new investors. This growth is fueled by mobile accessibility and intuitive trading interfaces[5](https://www.fia.org/marketvoice/articles/predicting-future-prediction-markets)[8](https://time.com/collections/time100-companies-2025/7289591/polymarket/).  \n\n## Comparative Insights\n| **Aspect**         | **Judgmental Forecasting**       | **Prediction Markets**          |  \n|---------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|  \n| **Primary Use**     | New products, data-scarce scenarios | Real-time event probabilities |  \n| **Accuracy Drivers**| Expert aggregation, scenario modeling | Crowd wisdom, algorithmic weighting |  \n| **2025 Trends**     | Hybrid qualitative-quantitative models | Regulatory formalization, AI augmentation |  \n\nJudgmental forecasting remains indispensable for innovation-driven contexts, while prediction markets are evolving into a regulated asset class with significant influence on media and finance.

The questions are divided into two time horizons: the next 3 months and the next year. Each question includes background information and an analysis of potential information hazards.\n\n### **3-Month Horizon**\n\nHere are five questions focused on the next three months:\n\n**1. If a Polymarket market is featured on the X (formerly Twitter) 'Explore' page for at least 7 consecutive days in July 2025, will Polymarket's monthly trading volume for August 2025 exceed $1 billion?**\n\n*   **Background:** In June 2025, X (formerly Twitter) named Polymarket its official prediction market partner, with plans to integrate its odds using X's Grok AI. This question aims to quantify the immediate impact of this high-profile partnership on platform activity.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \ud83d\udd2e This is a potential self-fulfilling prophecy. Widespread knowledge of a high-probability forecast could amplify trading activity, directly influencing the outcome.\n\n**2. Will the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) or any U.S. Attorney's Office publicly announce the filing of criminal charges against Polymarket or its CEO Shayne Coplan by October 9, 2025?**\n\n*   **Background:** In November 2024, the FBI raided the apartment of Polymarket's CEO as part of a criminal probe into the platform's activities, but no charges have been filed to date. This question addresses the significant regulatory and legal risk (a potential \"black swan\" event) hanging over the company.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f This could be seen as influencing legal or political outcomes. Widespread trust in a high-probability forecast could pressure the DOJ to act, creating indirect influence.\n\n**3. How many new sports-related event contract categories will Kalshi list on its platform by October 9, 2025?**\n\n*   **Background:** Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated prediction market, has identified sports as a major area for expansion. This question measures the pace and scale of this strategic initiative. As of July 9, 2025, there are 8 sports categories.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u2705 This question is safe. It asks about the business operations of a single company and is unlikely to have any broader effects.\n\n**4. Will Good Judgment Inc. announce a new forecasting project or an extension of the current project with a non-profit philanthropic organization (e.g., GiveWell, Open Philanthropy) by October 9, 2025?**\n\n*   **Background:** In March 2025, Good Judgment Inc. was commissioned by GiveWell and Open Philanthropy to forecast U.S. foreign aid funding. This represents a novel application of Superforecasting for strategic philanthropy. A new or extended project would signal that this initiative is considered successful.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u2705 This question is safe. It involves business announcements and partnerships, which are public-facing activities.\n\n**5. Will Metaculus, Good Judgment Inc., or Kalshi publicly announce a new feature that explicitly uses AI to weight, assist, or generate forecasts by October 9, 2025?**\n\n*   **Background:** AI integration is a key technological trend in the forecasting space. While some platforms use AI, it is not yet a mainstream feature on other major platforms. This question tracks the adoption of this key technology.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u2705 This question is safe. It concerns corporate announcements and product development, which are unlikely to be influenced by public forecasts.\n\n### **1-Year Horizon**\n\nHere are five questions focused on the next year:\n\n**1. By March 31, 2026, will Polymarket obtain a CFTC-issued Designated Contract Market (DCM) license, allowing it to legally offer event contracts to U.S. customers?**\n\n*   **Background:** Polymarket is one of the largest prediction markets by volume but is not registered to operate in the U.S. and is under investigation by the CFTC. Obtaining a license would be a major strategic pivot, legitimizing its operations in the U.S. market.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f This could be seen as influencing legal or political outcomes. Mass sentiment could indirectly pressure regulators via political/media channels.\n\n**2. How many new, distinct market *categories* will Kalshi add to its platform between July 9, 2025, and July 9, 2026?**\n\n*   **Background:** As the first CFTC-regulated event contract exchange, Kalshi's strength lies in its ability to expand its offerings legally. The number of new categories it opens is a direct indicator of its growth strategy. The current categories are: Sports, Politics, Economics, Weather, Entertainment, and Crypto.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \ud83d\udd2e This is a potential self-fulfilling prophecy. Widespread knowledge of the forecast could indirectly influence market hype and funding shifts.\n\n**3. Will Good Judgment Inc. and GiveWell publicly announce an extension or renewal of their forecasting partnership on U.S. foreign aid before the end of 2025?**\n\n*   **Background:** Good Judgment Inc. (GJI) was contracted by GiveWell in March 2025 to provide forecasts on U.S. foreign aid funding. The renewal of this contract would signal the success of the initial phase and the continued value of judgmental forecasting for strategic philanthropy.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u2705 This question is safe. The renewal of a partnership depends on institutional decisions, not public forecasts.\n\n**4. Will IARPA announce a new public-facing forecasting program or competition based on its Hybrid Forecasting Competition (HFC) research before July 1, 2026?**\n\n*   **Background:** IARPA's HFC was a research program aimed at developing platforms that integrate human forecasters with AI models. A new public-facing initiative would signal that this technology has matured and could create a new class of forecasting systems.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u2705 This question is safe. IARPA\u2019s decisions are institutional and unlikely to be swayed by public forecasts.\n\n**5. Conditional: If the CFTC obtains a court order explicitly banning Polymarket from serving any U.S. customers before March 31, 2026, will Kalshi's 30-day average trading volume increase by 50% or more in the month immediately following the ban?**\n\n*   **Background:** This question links the biggest threat in the prediction market space (Polymarket's regulatory risk) to the biggest opportunity for its main rival (Kalshi's growth). It seeks to quantify the direct impact of a potential market shock.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \ud83d\udd2e This is a potential self-fulfilling prophecy. Widespread knowledge of a forecast on this topic could influence user migration and trading behavior.",

The key takeaways were the increasing use of prediction markets for significant events like elections, their potential application in scientific validation, and the shifting landscape of economic forecasting methodologies used by institutions like the Bank of England. The articles also highlighted major platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi.\\n\\nTo dig deeper into the \"SWOT analysis\" and \"new features\" criteria requested by the client, I conducted targeted searches on the main players: Polymarket, Kalshi, and Metaculus, as well as the primary regulatory body, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\\n\\nThe research revealed several key tensions and drivers of change for the next three months:\\n- Explosive Growth vs. Regulatory Risk: Kalshi and Polymarket are experiencing rapid growth, securing massive funding rounds and striking major partnerships (e.g., Polymarket and X/Twitter). However, this is happening under a cloud of regulatory uncertainty from the CFTC, which has recently signaled a more restrictive stance on some types of markets (like political outcomes) while simultaneously being pressured to create a clearer framework. This presents both a major opportunity and a significant threat (a potential \"black swan\").\\n- Innovation and Mainstreaming: The platforms are actively innovating. Kalshi is expanding into sports markets and integrating with crypto applications like World App. Polymarket\\'s integration with X could bring prediction markets to a massive mainstream audience. Metaculus is focusing on improving user experience and accessibility to broaden the base of forecasters.\\n- Market Expansion: The platforms are constantly seeking new, popular topics for markets. Kalshi\\'s pivot to sports has been very successful, raising the question of what the next high-growth category will be.\\n\\nBased on these drivers, I have formulated five questions that aim to provide high-value information.

                        "text": "I have successfully generated the questions for both the 3-month and 1-year timeframes. Here are the questions, along with their background, resolution process, and an info-hazard analysis.\n\n### **Forecasting the Next 3 Months**\n\nHere are five questions designed to shed light on the state of judgmental forecasting and prediction markets in the next three months:\n\n**1. Trading Volume on Polymarket**\n\n*   **Question:** By October 9, 2025, will Polymarket's 30-day trading volume exceed $1.5 billion?\n*   **Background:** Polymarket, a leading decentralized prediction market, recently announced a major integration with the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). The company is also reportedly closing a funding round that values it at over $1 billion. Tracking trading volume is a key metric for assessing the success of these new initiatives and the platform's overall growth trajectory. An increase to $1.5 billion from its current levels (around $800 million monthly) would signify substantial new user adoption.\n*   **Resolution Process:** The resolution will be based on the 30-day trading volume statistic displayed on Polymarket's official stats page (https://polymarket.com/stats) on October 9, 2025. A screenshot of the page will be sufficient for verification.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u2705 This question is not an information hazard.\n\n**2. Kalshi's New Event Categories**\n\n*   **Question:** Will Kalshi introduce a new top-level event category on its platform before October 9, 2025?\n*   **Background:** Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated exchange, has found significant success by expanding its market offerings, particularly in sports. Identifying the \"next big thing\" is crucial for their growth. This question probes their ability to innovate and expand their product line into new domains that can attract users and trading volume.\n*   **Resolution Process:** This question resolves to \"Yes\" if Kalshi adds a new, distinct category of markets to its main \"All Markets\" page (https://kalshi.com/markets). The new category must be distinct from the existing top-level categories as of July 9, 2025 (Financials, Economy, Politics, Culture, Science, Sports, Weather, Awards). A new sub-market within an existing category will not count.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u2705 This question is not an information hazard.\n\n**3. CFTC and Political Contest Markets**\n\n*   **Question:** If the CFTC releases a proposed rule or guidance on event contracts before October 9, 2025, will it explicitly prohibit \"political contest\" markets?\n*   **Background:** The CFTC's stance is the most significant \"black swan\" risk for the prediction market industry. The agency has taken action against political markets (PredictIt) while allowing others to flourish under a \"self-certification\" process. A clear ruling would drastically alter the landscape, representing a major threat or opportunity for platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket.\n*   **Resolution Process:** This is a conditional question. It will only be resolved if the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) officially publishes a \"Proposed Rule,\" \"Final Rule,\" or official \"Guidance\" document concerning event contracts on its website (cftc.gov). If this condition is met, the question resolves to \"Yes\" if the document contains explicit language that forbids or proposes to forbid markets whose outcomes are determined by the results of state or federal elections.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u2705 This question is not an information hazard.\n\n**4. New Prediction Market Platforms in the News**\n\n*   **Question:** Before October 9th, 2025, will a new prediction market/forecasting platform (launched in 2025) be the subject of a feature article in The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, or The New York Times?\n*   **Background:** While Kalshi and Polymarket are the current leaders, the high growth and venture capital interest in the space could attract new, well-funded competitors. A feature in a major financial news outlet would be a strong signal that a new platform is gaining significant traction and is considered a serious challenger, indicating a potential shift in the competitive landscape.\n*   **Resolution Process:** A search will be conducted on the websites of The Wall Street Journal (wsj.com), Bloomberg (bloomberg.com), and The New York Times (nytimes.com) for articles published between July 9, 2025, and October 9, 2025. The question resolves to \"Yes\" if an article is found that is primarily about a specific prediction market or forecasting platform that launched publicly in 2025.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u2705 This question is not an information hazard.\n\n**5. Forecaster Engagement on Metaculus**\n\n*   **Question:** Will the number of unique forecasters on the Metaculus question \"When will the first week with >$1B in direct US-China trade happen?\" exceed 1,000 by October 9, 2025?\n*   **Background:** Metaculus is a non-financial forecasting platform focused on aggregating expert and amateur predictions on significant global events. The platform is currently focused on improving user onboarding and engagement. The number of forecasters on a high-profile, long-term geopolitical question serves as a good proxy for their success in attracting and retaining active, engaged users to tackle difficult forecasting problems.\n*   **Resolution Process:** The number of forecasters for this specific question will be checked on its page on metaculus.com. The number is publicly displayed below the question title.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u2705 This question is not an information hazard.\n\n### **Forecasting the Next Year**\n\nHere are five questions that look at the state of judgmental forecasting and prediction markets in the next year:\n\n**1. Automated Market Making in Prediction Markets**\n\n*   **Question:** Will a major prediction market platform (e.g., Kalshi, Polymarket, Manifold) release a new feature related to automated market making or liquidity provision by the end of 2024?\n*   **Background:** Automated market makers (AMMs) are a key component of decentralized finance (DeFi) and could significantly impact the liquidity and efficiency of prediction markets. This question explores the adoption of this technology by major platforms.\n*   **Resolution Process:** This question will resolve to 'Yes' if any of the specified platforms announce or release a feature that automates market making or liquidity provision. The announcement must be public and verifiable. The feature must be available to a substantial portion of the platform's user base.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u2705 This question is not an information hazard.\n\n**2. New Prediction Market Startups**\n\n*   **Question:** If the US SEC provides clear regulatory guidance for prediction markets in 2024, will at least two new venture-backed prediction market startups launch in the US within the following six months?\n*   **Background:** Regulatory uncertainty is a major obstacle to the growth of prediction markets in the US. This question explores the potential impact of favorable regulation on market entry.\n*   **Resolution Process:** This question is conditional on the US SEC providing clear regulatory guidance for prediction markets in 2024. If the condition is met, the question will resolve to 'Yes' if at least two new venture-backed prediction market startups, focused on the US market, announce their launch within six months of the guidance being issued. 'Venture-backed' means they have received funding from venture capitalists. The launch announcements must be public and verifiable.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u26a0\ufe0f This question has the potential to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. A high probability of \"yes\" could encourage VCs and entrepreneurs to enter the market, while a low probability could discourage them.\n\n**3. \"Black Swan\" Events in Prediction Markets**\n\n*   **Question:** Will a significant 'black swan' event, causing a major disruption to the normal functioning of a major prediction market, occur by the end of 2024?\n*   **Background:** 'Black swan' events are rare, high-impact events that are difficult to predict. This question aims to gauge the perceived risk of such an event in the prediction market space.\n*   **Resolution Process:** This question will resolve to 'Yes' if an event occurs that causes a major prediction market (e.g., Kalshi, Polymarket, Manifold) to be offline for more than 48 hours, or to lose a significant amount of user funds (over $1 million). The event must be widely reported and acknowledged by the platform.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \ud83d\udca3 This is a strong info-hazard. A high probability of a \"black swan\" event could cause a panic and a run on the platforms, potentially *causing* the very event it's trying to predict.\n\n**4. Corporate Adoption of Prediction Markets**\n\n*   **Question:** By the end of 2024, will there be a successful, widely-replicated initiative to use prediction markets for corporate forecasting and decision-making within a Fortune 500 company?\n*   **Background:** While the use of prediction markets for corporate forecasting has been explored for years, widespread adoption is still lacking. This question assesses the likelihood of a breakthrough in this area.\n*   **Resolution Process:** This question will resolve to 'Yes' if a Fortune 500 company publicly reports on the successful use of an internal prediction market for forecasting and decision-making, and if at least three other organizations (of any size) publicly announce that they are implementing a similar initiative based on that success. The reports must be verifiable.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u26a0\ufe0f This question could create a self-fulfilling prophecy. A high probability of \"yes\" could encourage companies to adopt prediction markets, while a low probability could discourage them.\n\n**5. Academic Research in Forecasting**\n\n*   **Question:** Will a major academic or research institution launch a new, large-scale research program dedicated to the study of judgmental forecasting and prediction markets by the end of 2024?\n*   **Background:** Academic research is crucial for advancing the understanding and application of forecasting methods. This question explores the level of institutional interest in the field.\n*   **Resolution Process:** This question will resolve to 'Yes' if a major academic or research institution (e.g., a top 50 university or a well-known research lab) announces the launch of a new research program specifically focused on judgmental forecasting and/or prediction markets. The announcement must be public and the program must have dedicated funding and personnel.\n*   **Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u2705 This question is not an information hazard.",

                "output": "Based on the search results, the current landscape of judgmental forecasting and prediction markets in 2025 features significant advancements in methodology, platform development, and risk monitoring. Key developments include:\n\n## Judgmental Forecasting Innovations\n- **Enhanced integration with machine learning**: New systems use ML to identify forecasts most likely to benefit from human judgmental adjustments, providing suggested adjustment ranges to reduce errors[4](https://forecasting-encyclopedia.com/practice.html)[5](https://www.drivetrain.ai/post/judgement-based-sales-forecasting). This is particularly valuable for high-volume products with historically high forecast errors.\n- **Structured expert frameworks**: The Delphi Method remains prominent for long-term technological and medical forecasting, using iterative expert panels to reach consensus[1](https://www.joinhomebase.com/blog/forecasting-models). Companies like pharmaceutical firms apply this for R&D investment decisions.\n- **Scenario analysis tools**: Startups and enterprises now systematically model multiple \"what-if\" scenarios (e.g., market growth, competitive threats, economic shifts) to stress-test forecasts[5](https://www.drivetrain.ai/post/judgement-based-sales-forecasting). This approach gained traction for navigating economic uncertainty.\n- **Hybrid quantitative-qualitative systems**: Platforms combine algorithmic forecasts with human override capabilities, where sales professionals inject market intuition and ground-level insights, especially in data-scarce environments[5](https://www.drivetrain.ai/post/judgement-based-sales-forecasting).\n\n## Prediction Market Platforms and Features\n- **Mainstream adoption**: Platforms like Polymarket gained prominence by accurately predicting 2024 election results hours before traditional media, attracting high-profile users[6](https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/12/prediction-markets-go-mainstream/).\n- **Financial market integration**: Good Judgment's Superforecasters outperformed futures markets by 30% in accuracy for Federal Reserve rate decisions in 2024-2025, demonstrating reliability for economic forecasting[8](https://goodjudgment.com).\n- **Diversified applications**: Leading platforms (Ruckus Market, Kalshi, Augur) now serve:\n  - **Business strategy**: Internal corporate markets forecasting sales and product success[2](https://helalabs.com/blog/best-prediction-market-platforms/)\n  - **Policy analysis**: Governments using markets to gauge policy impacts[2](https://helalabs.com/blog/best-prediction-market-platforms/)\n  - **Scientific research**: Prioritizing funding allocation via expert consensus[2](https://helalabs.com/blog/best-prediction-market-platforms/)\n- **Granular forecasting**: Research labs like CRUCIAL are testing markets for highly specific outcomes, such as monthly UK rainfall/temperature combinations[9](https://www.crucialab.net).\n\n## Black Swan Monitoring Initiatives\n- **Systematic risk catalogs**: Firms like BCA Research and CapRight published watchlists of low-probability, high-impact threats for 2025, including:\n  - Geopolitical shifts (China policy reversal, US-Iran nuclear deal, NATO abandonment)[3](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-black-swan-outlook-economy-trump-dollar-china-trade-2025-1)[7](https://www.capright.com/watchlist-of-12-black-swans/)\n  - Cybersecurity crises targeting infrastructure[7](https://www.capright.com/watchlist-of-12-black-swans/)\n  - Tariff-induced stagflation (KPMG notes 60% recession probability from April 2025 tariffs)[10](https://kpmg.com/us/en/articles/2025/april-2025-economic-compass.html)\n- **Real-time market sensors**: Prediction markets now function as early-warning systems, with platforms like Polymarket tracking military escalation probabilities (e.g., 75% probability of US-Iran conflict in 2025)[3](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-black-swan-outlook-economy-trump-dollar-china-trade-2025-1).\n\n## Emerging Initiatives\n- **Media collaborations**: Good Judgment partnered with *The Economist* for *The World Ahead 2025* forecasts on elections, tariffs, and conflicts[8](https://goodjudgment.com).\n- **Behavioral \"nudges\"**: Systems deploy ML classifiers to identify non-value-adding forecast overrides, prompting behavioral adjustments in forecasters[4](https://forecasting-encyclopedia.com/practice.html).\n- **Global model integration**: Deep learning systems now process massive variable sets (e.g., keyword trends for tourism demand) alongside judgmental inputs[4](https://forecasting-encyclopedia.com/practice.html).\n\nThese developments reflect a maturation of both fields, with judgmental forecasting adopting more structured, tech-enhanced approaches and prediction markets expanding into institutional decision-making while improving real-time risk assessment capabilities.",

The question resolves to \"Yes\" if any post in the main \"For You\" or \"Following\" feeds displays Polymarket odds or a direct link to a Polymarket market. Otherwise, it resolves to \"No\".\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:**  harmless \u2705 This question focuses on publicly available information about a business partnership and product integration. It does not reveal any sensitive or dangerous information.\n\n### 2. Kalshi's Market Focus: Sports vs. Politics\n\n*   **Question:** By October 9, 2025, will the number of active, non-expired sports-related markets on Kalshi exceed the number of active, non-expired politics-related markets?\n*   **Background:** After a favorable court ruling in May 2025 allowed it to continue offering political contracts, Kalshi has made a strategic push into sports markets. This question directly measures the scale and focus of this new initiative relative to their historical core business, providing insight into their strategic direction.\n*   **Resolution Process:** On the resolution date, I will navigate to the Kalshi website, access the \"Categories\" section, and count the number of active markets listed under the \"Sports\" and \"Politics\" categories. The question resolves to \"Yes\" if the Sports count is higher, and \"No\" otherwise.\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:** harmless \u2705 This question is about the number of markets on a public website and is not an info hazard.\n\n### 3. Good Judgment Inc.'s Expansion\n\n*   **Question:** Will Good Judgment Inc. issue a press release announcing a new forecasting partnership with a Fortune 500 company or a charity currently rated in GiveWell's top 5 charities between July 9, 2025, and October 9, 2025?\n*   **Background:** Good Judgment Inc. has historically partnered with governments and financial institutions. In March 2025, they announced a contract with GiveWell, a prominent non-profit evaluator, signaling a potential expansion. This question explores whether this is a one-off event or the start of a new initiative to bring judgmental forecasting to the broader corporate and philanthropic sectors.\n*   **Resolution Process:** I will monitor the official press releases and news section of the Good Judgment Inc. website. If a release announces a new partnership with a company on the most recent Fortune 500 list or a charity in GiveWell's top 5 (as of the announcement date), the question resolves to \"Yes\".\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:** harmless \u2705 This question is about a potential business partnership that would be publicly announced. It poses no infohazard risk.\n\n### 4. Black Swan Event: Military Conflict\n\n*   **Question:** Between July 9, 2025, and October 9, 2025, will any Polymarket market on a direct military conflict between two or more of the following - US, China, Russia, Iran - trade at or above 35%?\n*   **Background:** Several risk analysis firms and news outlets identified great power conflict as a potential \"black swan\" or major risk for 2025. Using a prediction market's real-time odds provides a quantifiable measure of perceived risk, acting as an early warning system for a high-impact event.\n*   **Resolution Process:** I will monitor Polymarket for any markets matching the description (e.g., \"Will the US and Iran engage in direct military conflict in 2025?\"). I will check the trading history of any such markets. If the probability on any of these markets touches or exceeds 35.0% during the specified period, the question resolves to \"Yes\".\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:** moderate \u2622\ufe0f This question is rated as a moderate info hazard. While the existence of the market is public information, drawing attention to a high probability of conflict could exacerbate tensions or be misinterpreted as a prediction of inevitable conflict, potentially influencing public or political actions in a negative way.\n\n### 5. Conditional Question: Kalshi's Innovation\n\n*   **Question:** If Kalshi adds at least 20 new, distinct sports-related markets between July 9, 2025, and September 9, 2025, will they also add at least one new market related to Artificial Intelligence (e.g., model releases, performance benchmarks) by October 9, 2025?\n*   **Background:** This question tests whether an aggressive expansion in one strategic area (sports) correlates with innovation in other high-tech, speculative areas (AI). For a regulated platform like Kalshi, listing novel markets like AI benchmarks is a significant step. This sheds light on their risk appetite and strategic priorities following their recent funding and legal victories.\n*   **Resolution Process:** First, I will validate the condition by checking Kalshi's \"Sports\" category on September 9, 2025, to confirm if at least 20 new markets were added compared to July 9, 2025. If the condition is met, I will then monitor Kalshi's new market listings until October 9, 2025. If a market with \"Artificial Intelligence,\" \"AI,\" \"LLM,\" \"GPT,\" or similar keywords in the title or rules is launched, the question resolves to \"Yes.\" If the condition is not met, or if the condition is met but no AI market is launched, it resolves to \"No.\"\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:** harmless \u2705 Harmless. This question is about the potential for a company to list new, publicly available markets on its website. It does not reveal any non-public information or create any hazards.\n\n***\n\n## \ud83d\udd2e Forecasting Questions: 1-Year Horizon\n\nHere are five questions focused on the next year:\n\n### 1. CFTC Regulation of Prediction Markets\n\n*   **Question:** By July 9, 2026, will the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) publicly propose a new rule or guidance specifically addressing the regulation of consumer-focused prediction markets?\n*   **Background:** The CFTC has historically been the primary regulator for markets dealing with futures contracts in the U.S. Prediction markets like Kalshi operate under CFTC oversight, while others like Polymarket have faced regulatory scrutiny. New, clearer guidance from the CFTC would be a major event, significantly impacting the growth, legality, and structure of these platforms in their largest potential market. This question addresses a key threat and regulatory uncertainty in the field.\n*   **Resolution Process:** Search the \"Press Releases,\" \"Proposed Rules,\" and \"Federal Register Notices\" sections of the CFTC's official website (cftc.gov) for any documents published between July 9, 2025, and July 9, 2026, that explicitly mention \"prediction markets,\" \"event markets,\" or \"event contracts\" in the context of new rules or guidance for platforms accessible to retail participants. The question resolves to \"Yes\" if such a document is found.\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:** harmless \u2705 This question is about public regulatory action and does not pose an infohazard.\n\n### 2. Good Judgment's Media Partnerships\n\n*   **Question:** Will Good Judgment launch a publicly announced partnership with a top-20 global news organization (by web traffic) to create a branded forecasting dashboard or content series by July 9, 2026?\n*   **Background:** Good Judgment has previously partnered with media outlets like *The Economist*. This question probes whether this successful initiative will be replicated, indicating a broader trend of mainstream media adopting rigorous forecasting methods. Success would represent a significant opportunity for the field to gain public trust and wider adoption.\n*   **Resolution Process:** The question will be resolved by checking the official blog/press release sections of Good Judgment's website (goodjudgment.com) and the websites of the top 20 news organizations as ranked by a reputable source like SimilarWeb in July 2026. Resolution is \"Yes\" if a formal partnership is announced.\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:** harmless \u2705 This question is about a potential business partnership that would be publicly announced. It poses no infohazard risk.\n\n### 3. AI-Powered Behavioral Nudges in Forecasting Platforms\n\n*   **Question:** By July 9, 2026, will at least three of the following five platforms (Hypermind, Metaculus, INFER, Good Judgment, Cultivate) publicly launch a new feature that explicitly uses AI/ML to provide forecasters with \"behavioral nudges\" or \"feedback\" on their inputs?\n*   **Background:** Research indicates that one of the most promising innovations in judgmental forecasting is the use of ML classifiers to identify and correct for human biases or non-value-adding overrides. This question targets a key technological advancement, measuring its adoption rate among leading platforms. Widespread adoption would be a major step forward, addressing a core weakness of purely judgmental forecasting.\n*   **Resolution Process:** The question will be resolved by reviewing the official blogs, product update pages, and any available user documentation for each of the five platforms. A feature qualifies if its description explicitly mentions using AI, machine learning, or algorithms to provide real-time feedback, warnings (e.g., \"you are deviating significantly from the aggregate\"), or suggestions to the user during the forecasting process.\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:** harmless \u2705 This question is about the adoption of a new technology that would be a public-facing feature. It's not an infohazard.\n\n### 4. Kalshi's Financial Market Expansion\n\n*   **Question:** Will Kalshi list at least ten new, distinct financial markets (e.g., related to inflation, Fed rates, or commodity prices) between July 9, 2025, and July 9, 2026?\n*   **Background:** While Kalshi offers a variety of event contracts, its core business and regulatory approval are centered on its financial markets. A significant expansion in this category would signal a strategy of deepening its focus on competing with traditional financial information and hedging instruments, representing a key strategic direction for the company and the regulated side of the industry.\n*   **Resolution Process:** This can be resolved by checking Kalshi's website. The \"Markets\" section contains a list of all active and past markets. We will compare a snapshot of their financial markets on the start date with the markets available on the resolution date.\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:** harmless \u2705 This question is about the number of markets on a public website and is not an info hazard.\n\n### 5. Conditional: CFTC Regulation and Polymarket's Market Share\n\n*   **Question:** If the CFTC proposes a new rule for prediction markets by March 1, 2026 (see Question 1), will Polymarket's share of global prediction market web traffic decrease by at least 15% between March 2026 and July 2026?\n*   **Background:** This question connects a major potential event (regulation) to its direct market impact. A new U.S. regulatory framework could either legitimize and harm offshore operators like Polymarket or it could create compliance burdens that slow them down. Polymarket currently leads in traffic due to its wider range of unregulated markets. This question tests the \"threat\" of regulation on the market leader's dominance.\n*   **Resolution Process:** This is a conditional question. If the condition (a CFTC rule proposal by March 1, 2026) is not met, the question resolves as \"N/A\". If the condition is met, we will use a publicly available web traffic analytics tool (like SimilarWeb) to measure Polymarket's percentage of traffic among a basket of top prediction market sites (e.g., Polymarket, Kalshi, Metaculus, Manifold) in March 2026 and again in July 2026. The question resolves to \"Yes\" if their market share drops by 15% or more.\n*   **Info Hazard Analysis:** harmless \u2705 This question is about the potential impact of public regulatory action on publicly available web traffic data. It does not pose an infohazard.",

No technical vulnerabilities, harmful methods, or dangerous data are revealed. Answers (yes/no) cannot be weaponized or cause physical/digital harm[1](https://www.forecast-based-financing.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Impact-based-forecasting-guide-2020.pdf)[4](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6ur8vDX6ApAXrRN3t/information-hazards-why-you-should-care-and-what-you-can-do). Forecasts about feature releases are unlikely to alter individual behavior. Users cannot directly influence platform development roadmaps, and community reactions (e.g., feedback) would not deterministically change release outcomes[2](https://training.fema.gov/emiweb/is/is393a/is393.a-lesson3.pdf)[5](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/15/4/WCAS-D-22-0140.1.xml). Widespread knowledge of the forecast would not create systemic incentives for platforms to accelerate/delay features. Development timelines depend on internal priorities, not public predictions. No reflexive market dynamics (e.g., panic buying) apply here[3](https://arc.lib.montana.edu/snow-science/objects/ISSW2024_O12.3.pdf)[5](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/15/4/WCAS-D-22-0140.1.xml). The proposed alternatives quantify outcomes across multiple platforms or aggregate features, eliminating single-platform bias. Both retain the original intent while avoiding unintended influence loops. Validation confirms neither alternative introduces hazards[1](https://www.forecast-based-financing.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Impact-based-forecasting-guide-2020.pdf)[5](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/15/4/WCAS-D-22-0140.1.xml). The question poses no information hazards. Business-development forecasts lack dangerous information or self-fulfilling dynamics at any scale.

If forecasters see a low probability, developers might abandon the tool, and users might avoid it, creating a self-defeating cycle[2](http://www.climatecentre.org/downloads/files/04_Menu_of_Triggers_For_Forecast_Based_Financing.pdf)[4](https://arc.lib.montana.edu/snow-science/objects/ISSW2024_O12.3.pdf).

No harmful knowledge (e.g., security vulnerabilities or dual-use risks) is disclosed.

If forecasters learn a breakthrough is likely, they might accelerate research, but this is marginal: Major organizations (e.g., Metaculus) operate independently of public forecasts. Individual researchers lack resources to single-handedly cause/block breakthroughs. If told a breakthrough is unlikely, motivation drops are negligible\u2014research incentives depend on funding and institutional goals, not predictions[3](https://training.fema.gov/emiweb/is/is393a/is393.a-lesson3.pdf)[4](https://arc.lib.montana.edu/snow-science/objects/ISSW2024_O12.3.pdf). Widespread knowledge of a high-likelihood forecast would not trigger collective action (e.g., stockpiling or panic), as no tangible public stakes exist. Conversely, low-probability forecasts wouldn\u2019t deter investment; forecasting R&D is driven by academic/industrial competition, not predictions[5](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6ur8vDX6ApAXrRN3t/information-hazards-why-you-should-care-and-what-you-can-do). Alternatives shift focus to verifiable outcomes (peer-reviewed studies, quantifiable accuracy gains) rather than subjective \"announcements.\" This avoids ambiguity in defining \"breakthrough\" and eliminates reliance on organizational PR, which could be influenced by non-technical factors.

                        "text": "Of course! I can help with that. This is a great topic for a set of forecasts. Here are some questions that I've generated to help you understand the state of judgmental forecasting and prediction markets in the next year.\n\n## 3-Month Horizon\n\nHere are five questions with a 3-month time horizon:\n\n### 1. New Features in Prediction Markets\n**Question:** Will a major prediction market platform (e.g., Kalshi, Polymarket, Manifold) release a new feature related to automated market making or liquidity provision by September 1, 2024?\n\n**Background:** The efficiency and accuracy of prediction markets heavily depend on liquidity. Automated market makers (AMMs) and other liquidity-providing features can significantly enhance the user experience and attract more participants. This question explores the competitive landscape and the pace of innovation in the prediction market industry.\n\n**Resolution Process:** This question will be resolved based on public announcements from major prediction market platforms (including but not limited to Kalshi, Polymarket, and Manifold) or the appearance of such features on their websites. The feature must be new and explicitly related to automated market making or liquidity provision.\n\n**Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u2705 **No Info-Hazard.** This question focuses on business decisions and does not reveal any sensitive information.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Black Swan Events\n**Question:** By September 1, 2024, will there be a publicly disclosed instance of a significant black swan event (e.g., a major security breach, a sudden regulatory crackdown) affecting a prominent forecasting organization?\n\n**Background:** The forecasting and prediction market landscape is vulnerable to unforeseen events that can have a significant impact. These \"black swan\" events can shape the industry's future by revealing vulnerabilities, triggering regulatory changes, or altering public perception.\n\n**Resolution Process:** This question will be resolved if a prominent forecasting organization (e.g., a prediction market platform, a forecasting research institute) publicly discloses a major, unexpected event that negatively affects its operations, such as a major security breach, a sudden regulatory action, or a significant financial loss.\n\n**Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u26a0\ufe0f **Potential Info-Hazard.** While the question itself doesn't expose sensitive details, widespread awareness of a high probability could incentivize malicious actors or lead to defensive measures, creating a moderate risk of a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n---\n\n### 3. New Forecasting Platforms\n**Question:** Will a new judgmental forecasting platform or tool with a novel feature (e.g., incorporating pre-mortem analysis, structured reasoning tools) gain significant traction (e.g., reach 1,000 active users) by September 1, 2024?\n\n**Background:** The field of judgmental forecasting is continuously evolving, with new platforms and tools emerging that aim to improve accuracy and user experience. This question tracks the adoption of innovative features that could become industry standards in the future.\n\n**Resolution Process:** This question will be resolved based on publicly available data or announcements from a new judgmental forecasting platform or tool that has launched within the last 18 months. The platform must have a novel feature and reach at least 1,000 active users by the deadline.\n\n**Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u26a0\ufe0f **Potential Info-Hazard.** A high probability of success could encourage developers and early adopters, while a low probability could discourage them, creating a self-fulfilling or self-defeating cycle.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Forecast Aggregation Initiatives\n**Question:** By September 1, 2024, will a prominent organization in the forecasting space (e.g., a research institute, a company) announce a new initiative focused on improving the aggregation of forecasts from diverse sources?\n\n**Background:** The \"wisdom of the crowd\" is a cornerstone of forecasting, and effective aggregation methods are crucial for maximizing accuracy. This question explores whether organizations are actively working on new ways to combine forecasts from different sources to produce more reliable predictions.\n\n**Resolution Process:** This question will be resolved if a prominent organization in the forecasting space makes a public announcement about a new initiative aimed at improving the aggregation of forecasts.\n\n**Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u26a0\ufe0f **Potential Info-Hazard.** Forecasts about such initiatives could mildly influence the priorities of organizations in the field, creating a slight feedback loop.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Media Influence (Conditional)\n**Question:** If a major mainstream media outlet (e.g., The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal) publishes a feature article on the growing importance of judgmental forecasting, will at least two other major organizations in the field launch similar public outreach campaigns within the following month?\n\n**Background:** Media coverage can significantly impact the public perception and adoption of new technologies and methodologies. This conditional question explores the potential ripple effects of mainstream media attention on the forecasting community.\n\n**Resolution Process:** This question will be resolved if, within one month of the publication of a feature article on judgmental forecasting in a major mainstream media outlet, at least two other major organizations in the forecasting field launch public outreach campaigns.\n\n**Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u2757\ufe0f **Info-Hazard.** A high-profile forecast on this topic could trigger herding behavior among organizations, creating a strong self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n## 1-Year Horizon\n\nHere are five questions with a 1-year time horizon:\n\n### 1. Regulated vs. Unregulated Markets\n**Question:** Will the total volume of trades on regulated US prediction markets (e.g., Kalshi) exceed the total volume of trades on unregulated prediction markets (e.g., Polymarket) for the entire year of 2025?\n\n**Background:** The regulatory landscape for prediction markets is a key factor that will shape their future. This question examines the competition between regulated and unregulated platforms and which model will attract more users and trading volume over the next year.\n\n**Resolution Process:** This question will be resolved based on publicly available data on the total trading volume for regulated and unregulated prediction markets for the calendar year 2025.\n\n**Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u26a0\ufe0f **Potential Info-Hazard.** While individual traders can't significantly impact the annual market totals, societal trust in the forecast could moderately influence capital flows between regulated and unregulated markets.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Hybrid Forecasting Models\n**Question:** By March 1, 2025, will a major forecasting organization announce a significant breakthrough in developing a hybrid forecasting model that effectively combines human judgment with AI-powered data analysis?\n\n**Background:** The synergy between human intuition and artificial intelligence is a promising frontier in forecasting. This question looks for significant advancements in hybrid models that could lead to more accurate and robust predictions.\n\n**Resolution Process:** This question will be resolved if a major forecasting organization announces a breakthrough in hybrid forecasting models, supported by evidence of improved performance over existing methods.\n\n**Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u2705 **No Info-Hazard.** This question focuses on technological advancements and does not pose any inherent risks.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Corporate Adoption\n**Question:** Will a new forecasting-related product or service be launched by March 1, 2025, that directly targets the corporate decision-making market and achieves a significant level of adoption (e.g., used by at least 10 Fortune 500 companies)?\n\n**Background:** The corporate world is a largely untapped market for forecasting products and services. This question explores whether new offerings can successfully penetrate this market and gain traction among major corporations.\n\n**Resolution Process:** This question will be resolved if a new forecasting-related product or service is adopted by at least 10 Fortune 500 companies by the resolution date.\n\n**Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u26a0\ufe0f **Potential Info-Hazard.** The visibility of a forecast could influence developer and investor behavior, creating a self-fulfilling or self-defeating dynamic.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Ethics of Prediction Markets\n**Question:** By March 1, 2025, will there be a significant shift in the public perception of the ethics of prediction markets, as evidenced by a substantial increase in negative media coverage or the initiation of a major regulatory investigation?\n\n**Background:** The ethical implications of prediction markets are a subject of ongoing debate. This question assesses the risk of a significant negative shift in public opinion or regulatory scrutiny that could impact the industry's future.\n\n**Resolution Process:** This question will be resolved if there is a major regulatory investigation into prediction markets or a significant and sustained increase in negative media coverage focusing on the ethics of the industry.\n\n**Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u2757\ufe0f **Info-Hazard.** Publicizing a high-likelihood forecast on this topic could directly trigger the negative media coverage or regulatory action it predicts, creating a strong self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Market Response to Shutdown (Conditional)\n**Question:** If a major prediction market platform is forced to shut down due to regulatory pressure, will the total trading volume on other platforms experience a surge of at least 50% within the following three months?\n\n**Background:** The resilience of the prediction market ecosystem is an important question. This conditional question explores how the market would react to the loss of a major platform and whether users would migrate to other platforms.\n\n**Resolution Process:** This question will be resolved by observing the total trading volume on other prediction market platforms in the three months following the shutdown of a major platform due to regulatory pressure.\n\n**Info-Hazard Analysis:** \u26a0\ufe0f **Potential Info-Hazard.** A forecast on this topic could influence user and regulator behavior in the event of a shutdown, creating a risk of a self-fulfilling or self-defeating outcome.",
